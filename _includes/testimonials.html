                                    Ross is a pleasure to work with. He listens to want I need, and works from there.
                                    Often vendors try to "sell" you what they have, not what you need. Ross makes sure he listens to want you really need, help
                                    you refine what you really need, and then strives to provide you with what you need. I strongly recommend Ross!

                                    Ross is on my short list of technology recruiters who break the mold for the industry.
                                    He's consistently patient, polite, informative, helpful, and easy to work with.
                                    Ross listens well to what's important to meet my needs, and doesn't waste my time with people who don't fit.
                                    He's open to flexible arrangements to land candidates, and clearly positively influences his team.
                                    I wish all agencies were as great to work with as RX2 Solutions, and Ross is a strong representation of
                                    their vanguard.

                                    Even thought we have never been able to do business together, I consider him a class act.
                                    His demeanor and attitude are very professional and I would recommend him to anyone who is looking for a
                                    trustworthy, engaging, professional, IT recruiter.

                                    listened to what I wanted, set realistic expectations, and followed up when I asked him to.

                                    He followed up professionally when he promised to do so and has never given me the "hard sell".
                                    When I started searching for a new opportunity, I was comfortable with reaching out to Ross in confidence.
                                    He kept everything confidential and only sent my resume to companies that I approved.
                                    I would suggest to anyone who is looking for a trustworthy IT recruiter should give Ross and his team a
                                    chance to assist. They have always done well for me personally.

                                    Ross' creative communication methods made RX2Solutions stand out to me against all the other recruiters who
                                    had contacted me over the years. It was an absolute pleasure working with him and his team to acquire my
                                    latest position; they made the job search, interview, and compensation negotiation process infinitely easier.
