<b>SUMMARY</b>
Two to Three sentences…
In the objective, tell the employer what YOU are going to do for them – not the other way around.

<b>SKILLS </b>
Keep this section relevant to things you have done RECENTLY in a PROFESSIONAL setting.  People make the mistake of putting things on here that they used in a class their sophomore year that they haven’t used in a long time.

<b>PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</b>
Start with the most recent experience first and write this section from the perspective of the job that you want – NOT the jobs that you’ve had
Format the sections as bullet points rather than paragraphs
The bullet points should be ordered by importance for your NEXT job.  If you struggle here, ask yourself what does your next employer care more about and it should break any ties.
Be consistent with verb tense throughout – example, don’t switch from past to present tense.

<b>PART-TIME AND INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE</b>
For relatively recent college grads, add this section.  
If the experience isn’t directly related to the job you are applying for, highlight the areas where you learned about responsibility, communication, customer service, taking direction, and being a team player.

<b>EDUCATION & CERTIFICATIONS</b>
No need to put your GPA or relevant coursework
