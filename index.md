sectiontitle: Respectfully Professional Process
sectionmain: The goal of the Respectfully Professional Process is to provide Quality over Quantity and Relationships over Transactions – ultimately saving time for everyone.  We achieve this goal by gaining a deep understanding of what both the client and the job seeker are looking for while treating everyone the way that we want to be treated.  The result is that we deliver a solution that works for everyone.

    short: It’s our goal to build relationships. Needs analysis for clients, career goals, objectives, and background for job seekers.
    long: When engaging a client, we perform an initial needs analysis to ascertain what you  are looking for, what you want to avoid, and then only present solutions that are a fit. When engaging a job seeker, we spend time to understand  career goals, objectives, and background before discussing opportunities or compensation. It’s our goal to build long-term relationships rather than just throw out a job and salary to see if we can make a transaction happen.
