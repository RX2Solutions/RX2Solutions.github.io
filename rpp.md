The goal of the _Respectfully Professional Process_ is to provide Quality over Quantity and Relationships over Transactions – ultimately saving time for everyone.  We achieve this goal by gaining a deep understanding of what both the client and the job seeker are looking for while treating everyone the way that we want to be treated.  The result is that we deliver a solution that works for everyone.

## Discovery
**Client:** When engaging  a client, we perform an initial needs analysis to ascertain what you  are looking for, what you want to avoid, and then only present solutions that are a fit.

**Job Seeker:** When engaging a job seeker, we spend time to understand  career goals, objectives, and background before discussing opportunities or compensation.  It’s our goal to build  long-term relationships rather than just throw out a job and salary to see if we can make a transaction happen. 

## Approach
**Client:** Anyone can match keywords on a resume to your job description - what separates RX2 Solutions is that we go much deeper to ensure fit.  Our value add is that we take the extra time to vet candidates and to provide options based on your specific requirements. We provide candidates across your budget range so you can see a broad cross-section of the current market. 

**Job Seeker:** We are here to be on your team and to be your advocate.  It’s our job to open doors for you and provide market insight so you can make informed decisions.   We only present you to opportunities after we have gone through our process and you give us the approval to do so.

## Communication & Deployment
We will be in touch with you throughout the entire process as a trusted advisor to help facilitate hiring, share progress, report market conditions and set reasonable expectations.

## Recalibration
We understand that things change.  If your needs while we are working together and we need to adjust, we are highly adaptable.
