&lt;p&gt;From a combined 40-years of professional experience helping job seekers find new opportunities, here are the RX2 Solutions principles for writing a strong resume:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use the Three C’s of Resume Writing: Clean, Consistent, Concise.&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Clean: does the resume look appealing to the eye?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Consistent: are your verb tenses and formatting consistent?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Concise: less is more!  Did you say what you needed to in as few words as possible?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The resume should be written using the following perspective:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What’s in it for me (from the employer’s perspective)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Write the resume for the job that you WANT, not for the jobs that you’ve HAD&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s OK to have multiple versions of your resume if you are open to multiple types of opportunities
     3. Put the responsibilities with the biggest impact at the TOP of each opportunity – don’t make me fish through fluff to find the good stuff…tell me up front.
     3. Less is more. If you can say something in five words instead of ten, say it in five.  If you can combine two bullet points into one, then do it.  The fewer words and fewer pages of a resume, the better!&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words never to use in a resume:&lt;/strong&gt; I, We, Responsible (for).  This is your resume, so its assumed that everything in here is about you and that you were responsible for everything in the resume.  Saying these words is redundant and not necessary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The top of the resume should include:&lt;/strong&gt; your Full Name, City, State, and Zip Code you live in (not your full address), phone number and email address.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make the email address professional and easy. Ideally, it should be some version of your name and a simple number.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Email Domain: For the email address, please choose either GMAIL, Yahoo, Hotmail, or your own personal website domain name.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For recent college grads – it may be OK to use your school email address but at some point (soon) you are going to want to move away from that to another email address that’s much more common and easy to remember/type.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills section:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a fan of the skills section – but only to a point.  Everything in your resume (including the skills section) should be something that you worked with PROFESSIONALLY.  The content on here should be relevant.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be concise. This isn’t your chance to list everything you’ve ever done. Keep this section relevant, detailed, and concise.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Technologies that are no longer used should not be in your resume for example: Lotus Notes, Windows 95,98,XP, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Too many times, recent college grads put everything in here that they ever did including a class that they took their Freshman year that has nothing to do with the JOB THEY WANT. That stuff doesn’t enhance your resume and does more harm than good.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Everything on your resume is FAIR GAME during an interview. If you have it on your resume, you better know about it.  If its been a while and you don’t remember it as well as you should, then either refresh yourself on it OR take it out of the resume.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Objective:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m a big fan of including objectives in the resume.  It should tell your future employer what value you can bring and the type of job that you are looking for.  It should read like the headline of a newspaper.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Example: Network Engineer with fifteen years of proven experience working in medium to enterprise level environments who is looking to leverage a proven track record to bring value to an organization.  Coachable, goal-oriented team player who thrives with both minimal and detailed instructions to accomplish company driven objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right-sizing your Role Titles:&lt;/strong&gt; Your title should accurately describe what you did and doesn’t necessarily need to be the official title that the company gave you.
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you were the CEO of a three person company and are now looking for a mid-level manager role – consider right-sizing. Yes, your official title may have been CEO, but you were really a sales rep and an operations manager – so change your title to that.  If your potential employer sees CEO on your resume, they most likely will think you are overqualified and skip you because “its too big of a step back”.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Conversely, if you were a “staff accountant” but managed three direct reports and handled all of the responsibilities of the month end close – say that you were the Accounting Supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Don’t use this section to lie, but right-sizing your title can go a long way to getting the job that you are qualified for and deserve.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resume Bullet Points:&lt;/strong&gt; under each role, you should have bullet points that say what you did.  I’ve seen resumes that just have blocks of text and this should be avoided.  Again, the MOST impactful thing you did in the role should be the first bullet point listed and then you should go on to the second most impactful, then third most impactful, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consistency is Key:&lt;/strong&gt;
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Start every bullet point with a past tense verb. Even if you are currently employed and currently performing the responsibility, use a past tense verb because you can’t go wrong with it.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Don’t start multiple bullet points in a row with the same verb – break it up a little by using synonyms from time to time so you aren’t saying the exact same thing over and over.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure you either end every bullet point with a PERIOD (.) or none of them with a period. Be consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For month/date make sure you are using all of the same formatting. Our suggestion is just to spell out the full month instead of abbreviating it.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Each month should line up in the same place; we suggest using the far right side of the screen. Every bullet point should be indented the same amount and the font on the resume should be consistent throughout.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unless you are in the creative space, we highly recommend using only one color of ink in the resume and that color should be black.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section Order:&lt;/strong&gt; the order that you put your resume together in matters!
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The order and format we recommend is: Name and contact info, Objective, (Skills), Professional Experience, (Volunteer, Part-Time, Internship experience), Education and Certifications.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What is not included: “References Available Upon Request” should not be present on a resume. It is assumed that you are willing to furnish references prior to an offer being extended.  Also, your age, marital status, a photo of you&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Volunteer work, part-time work, and side hustles should go below PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE and should each have their own sections. Often times these “non-full time” roles overlap with other opportunities and if you put them in the same section as your full time work, it can be confusing.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Education and Certifications should at the bottom of the resume – except if you are a recent college grad. If you recently graduated, this section should go above your part-time and internship experience.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe this sounds familiar: It’s the hottest job market in recent memory and your company is growing. Since unemployment is at 50-year lows, new members to your team are being brought in at a premium in order to attract top-level talent. Your 2-4% annual raise is being outpaced by the market leaving proven contributors who have already been in the trenches to feel alienated, underpaid and underappreciated. After thinking about the salary for weeks or months, it’s time to ask for a raise. So now what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;negotiation-prep-work&quot;&gt;Negotiation Prep Work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never negotiate anything unless you are prepared to walk away. Before you go down the road of asking for a raise, you need to figure out what you’ll do if the conversation doesn’t go the way you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“Walking” in this case doesn’t mean quitting on the spot or doing something irrational that forces your employer to fire you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walking away&lt;/em&gt; here means that you are prepared to leave the company – on your terms. This means performing due diligence on your next role, naturally going through the hiring process elsewhere, putting in two weeks’ notice and avoiding burning bridges when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leverage in negotiation comes from figuring out the other side’s best alternative and making your best alternative seem as strong as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The employer’s best alternative is usually to give the work to someone else or to hire someone to replace you. Before starting the negotiation, take a hard look at what it would look like at your company if you weren’t there and try to figure out how much pain it will cause your company if you move on. If the answer is “not much” then it’s probably not the best time to ask for a raise…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Your best alternative is finding another job; this could be another job that you have already secured an offer for or it can be based on the research you’ve done in regard to current market rates for people with a similar skill set. In either case, do your research before starting the conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of your research, we recommend you &lt;strong&gt;work with a consultative recruiter such as RX2 Solutions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good recruiter will be interested in forming a relationship with you and won’t care that you aren’t completely sure if you’re ready to make a move yet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For additional information about selecting the right recruiter for you, please see Why work with a Quality-First Recruiter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;scheduling-the-conversation&quot;&gt;Scheduling the Conversation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timing is everything. Find the appropriate time to have the conversation and make sure that the meeting is scheduled ahead of time. A good time to address the topic is during an annual or quarterly review. If your company doesn’t have regular reviews good timing might be after a big win or the completion of a successful project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;during-the-meeting&quot;&gt;During the Meeting&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come prepared. Prepare everything that you can ahead of time from rehearsing what you are going to say, doing your research, and controlling the things that you can control.  Clearly state your good reasons for asking for a raise. Keep the conversation focused on you and keep it positive. Come up with a business case or proposition as to why you deserve the raise and include successes that you’ve had (especially recent successes), performance compared to goal and highlighting the value that you bring to the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avoid bad reasons. Bad reasons include discussing what others are making or doing, threatening to leave or quit, or steering the conversation away from facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly define the next steps. End the meeting by establishing a timeline for the next steps so that you can hold management accountable for a timeline for getting you an answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get whatever is agreed to in writing. It doesn’t need to be as formal as a new employment contract (yet), but whatever is decided at the end of the meeting, it’s a best practice to write it down so everyone is on the same page. It can be as simple as an email to your manager recapping the conversation/next steps and asking them to confirm that everything in your email is correct.&lt;/p&gt;

Either way, you’re looking to hire a full-time employee in the hottest candidate market in the past 60 years. A little background on today’s current market:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, unemployment across the board in the U.S. is 3.5% (https://data.bls.gov/). To put this in context, unemployment was around 10% during the great recession and “full-employment” is 4.6%.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full-employment is the percentage of people employed where wages start to inflate because demand for workers outpaces supply. Unemployment includes all industries and job types across full-time, part-time, and seasonal workers who are actively looking for work but are not working. Specific areas that require high amounts of skill, like the roles that RX2 Solutions specializes in filling, have significantly lower local/regional unemployment rates, estimated in the 0-2% range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many RX2 Solutions customers reach out to us as a first step when they are looking to hire. They appreciate our consultative nature, Respectfully Professional values, and our Quality over Quantity recruiting approach. RX2 Solutions is a trusted partner with all our clients providing them a wide variety of staffing solutions – but why work with a Quality first organization? Maybe this sounds like your company, maybe it doesn’t:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some organizations believe - “why pay a headhunter to help fill the role if I can fill it on my own?” So, you create a job description, go to the job boards to post your job and wait for the resumes to flow in. Depending on the role you are hiring for, you may find your candidate and you may not. However with unemployment being so low – I’ve heard from numerous organizations who post their open jobs that they are often inundated with candidates who aren’t a fit and they spend hours sifting through unqualified candidates to try to find a diamond in the rough often leading to a big waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not start with a trusted solution to hire in in this environment? RX2 Solutions has several proprietary methods to help identify your ideal candidate and here are some best practices to have the most success possible in your search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make time for a call or meeting with the recruiter and the direct hiring manager.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If everything goes through HR, HR should attend the meeting as well.&lt;/em&gt; Investing 15-30 minutes of a busy hiring manager’s time to discuss the ideal candidate will save time over the course of the search&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamline your interview process.&lt;/strong&gt; Provide timely and meaningful feedback. When interviewing, fit everyone that the candidate needs to meet into one or two on-site visits. An extended interview process is one of the largest turnoffs for a candidate - and significantly increases the chance of having competing offers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate with the candidate through their recruiter (this includes discussing salary).&lt;/strong&gt; Communication is key in life, when you are provided a candidate from RX2 Solutions, the salary expectations are discussed several times before you receive the resume and the expectation from the candidate is that a competitive offer will meet or exceed their salary number. Allow us to help you; we know your interview process, how your organization likes to make offers, and what else a candidate has going us because of this we’ll be able to streamline and simplify the interview-to-hire process at your organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stop worrying about internal equity - make an offer based on the market.&lt;/strong&gt; The U.S. economy has been above “full employment” for 30+ months and counting, with some sectors being at full employment for significantly longer than that. This high demand and low supply market have caused wages across the board to increase higher than inflation. If most of your team was hired more than 30 months ago, chances are your “internal equity” is below or well below the market. If someone down the street is willing to pay your ideal candidate more, offer better benefits, more vacation time, higher bonus, etc. you need to meet or beat your competition to remain competitive and attract top level talent. Artificially pegging your offered compensation to internal equity will often cause you to lose out on the A-level player that will help take your company to the next level.
Partnering with a Quality-First Recruiter can and should be one of the most reward experience your company should have. You will fill your key positions in a tight employment market as well as saving your organization time and money from not having this person in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
