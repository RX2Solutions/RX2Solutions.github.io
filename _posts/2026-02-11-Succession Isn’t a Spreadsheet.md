# How Organizations Actually Prepare Future Leaders

## Executive Summary

Succession planning is widely recognized as critical for long-term business success, yet many organizations still fall short in practice. Research shows that while 86% of leaders consider succession planning an “urgent” or “important” priority, only 14% believe their companies do it well. In fact, only about half of critical leadership roles can be immediately filled by internal candidates in the average organization, leading to costly talent gaps and reactive <!--more-->external hires. This white paper argues that succession is not a static exercise of names on a spreadsheet. It must become a dynamic, integrated process of cultivating leaders who are ready for what the business will need next.

Executives, especially CEOs, boards, CHROs, and HR strategists, face a paradox. They know a strong leadership pipeline is essential to navigate disruption, yet traditional approaches often reduce succession to an annual “check-the-box” routine. Too often, succession plans are lists filed away, disconnected from development, and quickly outdated by fast-changing business needs. Such traditional approaches suffer from major pitfalls: over-reliance on tenure or gut feel, insular decision-making, risk aversion, fear of destabilizing current leaders, and unclear accountability. The result is a significant gap between succession planning intent and outcomes. That gap can leave organizations scrambling when vacancies arise.

Forward-thinking companies are moving beyond static tools toward dynamic leadership cultivation. This paper explores emerging frameworks that blend disciplined succession processes with continuous development. A “centered” approach, balancing data-driven rigor with engagement and trust, is proving more effective at building a sustainable leadership bench. New practices like dynamic scenario planning help boards prepare multiple succession scenarios and leadership profiles for an uncertain future. Organizations are also weaving succession into daily operations through leadership academies, rotational assignments, mentorship networks, and internal mobility programs. These interventions shift the mindset from “Is someone ready?” to “How do we get them ready?” (a theme reinforced in recent HBR work).

Real-world lessons from life sciences and manufacturing underscore the urgency of this shift. In life sciences, where innovation and market dynamics evolve rapidly, companies have learned that narrow CEO “templates” and outdated pipelines can hinder growth and delay transitions. In manufacturing, an aging workforce and Industry 4.0 pressures make leadership continuity a strategic imperative. Leading manufacturers pair succession plans with knowledge transfer and upskilling to ensure critical know-how and modern operating capabilities do not leave at retirement.

This white paper provides strategic recommendations for executives to modernize succession planning in any industry. Key actions include establishing clear ownership and metrics, integrating succession with leadership development, using assessments and data to identify high-potential talent, and embedding accountability at all levels. The paper highlights practical approaches such as cross-functional rotations, leadership simulations and scenario exercises, and internal mobility systems that help leaders gain the experiences they will need before vacancies arise.

In conclusion, organizations that treat succession as a living process will be better positioned to thrive amid disruption. By moving beyond static succession spreadsheets to dynamic leadership cultivation, companies can close the gap between knowing succession is important and actually doing it well. The outcome is more than smooth leadership transitions. It is a robust pipeline of capable leaders ready to drive the business forward.

## Introduction

Every CEO and board understands, at least in theory, that the future of the organization depends on having the right leaders ready at the right time. Yet despite this consensus, effective succession planning remains elusive. Many companies approach succession as a static, periodic exercise, a list of potential successors tucked away in an HR spreadsheet. The title of this paper, “Succession Isn’t a Spreadsheet,” reflects a critical truth: naming future leaders is not the same as preparing them. A name in a box does not guarantee a capable successor when the moment of need arrives. In reality, how an organization develops and readies its talent makes the difference between smooth leadership continuity and a damaging leadership void.

A cautionary scenario described in recent Harvard Business Review work is familiar to many executives: a leader leaves with short notice, the “plan” exists on paper, but when the time comes, nobody feels confident the listed candidates can step in and win. The organization defaults to an external search, loses momentum, and performance suffers during the interim. This scenario plays out too often. It illustrates the cost of treating succession planning as paperwork rather than preparation.

Today’s environment, defined by rapid technological change, demographic shifts, and constant disruption, makes traditional approaches even more inadequate. Succession planning is a long-term discipline in a short-term world. When leaders avoid succession discussions, postpone hard decisions, or fail to connect succession to real development, succession becomes reactive instead of proactive.

This paper makes the case that organizations must elevate succession planning from a static HR exercise to a dynamic, enterprise strategy. We examine trends reshaping succession, why traditional approaches fail, and the frameworks leading organizations use to build stronger leadership pipelines. Life sciences and manufacturing provide a practical lens, but the lessons apply broadly.

## Trends in Succession Planning

### 1. Acknowledgment of a Readiness Gap
Leaders increasingly admit the gap between intent and execution. Deloitte reports 86% of leaders see succession as urgent or important, yet only 14% think their organizations do it well. DDI reports that only about 49% of critical leadership roles can be filled immediately by internal candidates.

### 2. Higher Turnover Expectations at the Top
A Spencer Stuart survey found that one-third of HR leaders expect nearly 60% of CEOs and their direct reports to leave their roles over the next five years. This expectation pushes boards and executives to plan further ahead, and for more roles than just the CEO.

### 3. A Shift Toward Building Internal Capability
Recent reporting on DDI’s 2025 findings highlights that HR leaders are prioritizing internal development more heavily, while confidence in succession readiness remains low. This reflects a practical reality: external hiring is expensive, risky, and slow in many markets.

### 4. Broader Scope Beyond the C-Suite
Organizations are expanding succession planning to include roles where leadership gaps can stall execution: regional managers, plant leaders, R&D heads, and other mission-critical positions. The goal is a deeper bench across the organization, not just at the top.

### 5. “Future-Ready” Planning Over Replacement Planning
More organizations are defining the capabilities the business will need in 3 to 5 years and building development plans to match. HBR’s recent work stresses that traditional replacement planning often cannot keep pace with how fast leadership requirements evolve.

### 6. Increased Use of Data and Structured Processes
Companies are using assessments, dashboards, and structured governance to reduce subjectivity and improve decision quality. McKinsey highlights the value of depersonalizing succession decisions through structured approaches.

## Challenges in Traditional Approaches

1. **“Names in Boxes” Mentality**  
   A static list of successors creates false confidence. Without deliberate development and testing, those names are aspirations, not plans.

2. **Lack of Accountability and Ownership**  
   Succession often fails because unclear ownership leads to inaction.

3. **Subjectivity and Comfort Picks**  
   Familiarity can outweigh readiness without structured evaluation.

4. **Fear of Destabilizing the Current Team**  
   Avoiding succession discussions creates greater instability later.

5. **Short-Term Pressure Crowding Out Long-Term Development**  
   Long-term readiness is deferred in favor of immediate results.

6. **Overly Rigid or Competitive Processes**  
   Excessive rigidity discourages engagement and growth.

7. **Separation of Succession From Development**  
   Naming successors without development planning undermines readiness.
