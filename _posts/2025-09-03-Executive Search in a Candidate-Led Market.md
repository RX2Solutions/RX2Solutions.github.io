## What Executive Candidates Want in 2025 ‚Äì And What Turns Them Off

In 2025, recruiting senior leaders is less about telling them how great the job is, and more about showing that your opportunity aligns with their values, career goals, and expectations. Intangibles matter as much as the paycheck.  

Seasoned executives are looking for deeper factors that signal a compelling opportunity. Here are the top things today‚Äôs leaders want (and what turns them off when missing):

### 1. Clarity of Mission and Vision
- Executives want to know the **‚Äúwhy‚Äù** of a business.  
- They ask: *What exactly is this company trying to achieve? Who are the customers and what is the value proposition?*  
- A fuzzy or generic mission loses serious candidates. Lofty but vague slogans won‚Äôt cut it.  
- **Turn-off:** Mixed messages, muddled vision, or leadership that appears unsure.  
- **Turn-on:** A clear, credible mission ‚Äì especially one that aligns with their personal values or ambition.

### 2. Speed and Confidence in the Hiring Process
- Time is precious, and the hiring process itself signals company culture.  
- **Turn-off:** Long gaps between interviews; slow = sloppy in their eyes.  
- **Turn-on:** A brisk, coordinated process that shows decisiveness and respect.  
- Hiring is the first negotiation; moving quickly signals confidence and value.

### 3. Transparency on Leadership and Strategy (Ownership/Exit)
- Executives want to know: Who‚Äôs in charge? What‚Äôs the 3‚Äì5 year strategy? Is an IPO or sale likely?  
- **Turn-off:** Hidden details, sugarcoating, or forcing them to ‚Äúdig‚Äù for key info.  
- **Turn-on:** Candor about ownership, governance, and constraints. Trust is built through transparency.

### 4. Authenticity and ‚ÄúReal Talk‚Äù
- Experienced leaders have sharp BS detectors.  
- **Turn-off:** Glossy, ‚Äúeverything is perfect‚Äù narratives.  
- **Turn-on:** Admitting challenges (outdated products, cultural hurdles, competition) and framing how the executive can help solve them.  

**Other 2025 trends executives care about:**  
- Flexibility & work-life balance (even at senior levels).  
- Strong culture of talent development.  
- Commitment to diversity and inclusion.

## Tailoring Outreach That Lands: Engaging the Passive Leader

Most top executives are passive candidates, not actively job-hunting. Reaching them requires **finesse and personalization**. Generic recruiter messages won‚Äôt work.

### Key Approaches:
- **Do Your Homework:** Go beyond LinkedIn. Learn their achievements, thought leadership, and passions. Personalize outreach that connects their accomplishments to your role.  
- **Lead with Value Proposition:** Hook them with the *impact* and *opportunity*, not a dry job description. Position them as the hero of the story.  
- **Multi-Channel & Old-School Touches:** Combine email, LinkedIn, phone calls, and warm introductions. Executives often respect direct, professional calls.  
- **Candidate Experience in Outreach:** Every touchpoint matters; be prompt, authentic, and respectful. Confidentiality is non-negotiable.  
- **Trusted Introductions:** Use networks and peers. A warm intro from a trusted contact raises response rates dramatically.

**Golden Rule:** Outreach is the beginning of a long-term professional relationship, not a transaction.

## Retained vs. Contingent Search: Which Model Works When?

When recruiting senior-level talent, the choice between **retained** vs. **contingent** search matters. Each has its place.

### Contingent Search (Pay-for-Placement)
- **How it works:** Paid only if a placement is made.  
- **Strengths:** Speed, high volume, lower upfront risk.  
- **Best for:** Lower-tier roles, mid-level hires, urgent bulk hires.  
- **Trade-offs:** Incentivizes quick submissions over precision. Market perception can suffer if multiple agencies blast the same role.

### Retained Search (Exclusive Partnership)
- **How it works:** Paid in stages, with upfront commitment. Exclusive, in-depth process.  
- **Strengths:** Depth, dedication, precision, thorough candidate vetting. True partnership.  
- **Best for:** Executive, strategic, or confidential hires.  
- **Trade-offs:** Higher cost, longer process, but yields stronger long-term fit.

### Guidance
- **Retained:** Use for CEO, CFO, or mission-critical leadership roles. Especially in a candidate-led market, it signals seriousness and professionalism.  
- **Contingent:** Use for non-critical, high-volume, or urgent hires where a broad pool exists.  
- **Mixed Models:** Some organizations use retained for senior roles, contingent for others.  

**Bottom Line:**  
- Contingent = speed, volume, transactional needs.  
- Retained = strategy, quality, long-term alignment.  
- Miscasting the approach (e.g., contingent for a CEO) risks costly mis-hires.
