# Why “Good Enough” Leaders Are Falling Short

## Introduction

In today’s ultra-competitive business environment, the bar for leadership performance has never been higher. Companies are operating in a high-expectation market, one in which employees, investors, and boards demand more from leaders than ever before. CEOs and executives face relentless pressure to deliver results amid talent shortages, shifting workforce dynamics, generational culture changes, economic volatility, and rapid technological disruption. <!--more-->Leadership approaches that may have been “good enough” in the past are increasingly inadequate in this new context. Organizations are finding that mediocre leadership isn’t just suboptimal, it actively hinders performance, erodes stakeholder confidence, and impedes the ability to navigate complexity.

This white paper explores why previously acceptable leadership behaviors and competencies are now leading to underperformance. We examine the heightened expectations coming from all directions, from employees on the front lines to venture capital investors and corporate boards in the boardroom. We then discuss how some time-honored leadership principles drawn from U.S. military practice (such as mission command, strict accountability, and adaptive decision-making) offer a powerful model for high-performance leadership under pressure. These principles, centered on clear purpose, empowerment, and agility, can help business leaders meet modern challenges head-on.

Specific contemporary challenges are addressed in depth, including:

- **Talent Scarcity and Retention:** How a war for talent means leadership quality directly impacts the ability to attract and keep the best people.
- **Remote and Hybrid Workforce Dynamics:** Why leading distributed teams demands greater trust, communication, and outcome-focused management.
- **Generational Expectations:** How Millennials and Gen Z in the workforce expect more purpose, feedback, and work-life balance, and grow disengaged under uninspiring or antiquated leadership styles.
- **Economic Uncertainty:** The need for resilient, decisive leadership when facing inflation, market volatility, and ambiguity in the global economy.
- **Technological Disruption:** The imperative for leaders to drive innovation and adaptability amid digital transformation and breakthroughs like artificial intelligence.

Throughout, we cite research and expert commentary from credible, U.S.-based sources such as Harvard Business Review, McKinsey, Deloitte, SHRM, and others to ground our insights in data. Examples of leadership successes and failures are included to illustrate key points. Finally, we provide actionable takeaways for CEOs, private equity partners, and founders on how to raise the leadership game, whether that means hiring for a new profile of leader or developing one’s own leadership competencies to meet the moment.

The message is clear: “good enough” is no longer good enough. In a high-expectation market, only high-performance leadership will position organizations to thrive. It’s time to closely examine leadership standards and embrace new models that align with today’s elevated expectations.

## The Pressures Shaping Today’s Leadership Landscape

Modern executives are operating under intense scrutiny and competing demands unlike anything seen in previous generations. Understanding the forces driving this high-expectation market is the first step in recognizing why average leadership won’t suffice. Three stakeholder groups in particular, employees, investors, and boards, are ratcheting up the pressure on leaders to perform at the highest level.

### Rising Expectations from Employees

Today’s workforce is more empowered and vocal in its expectations of leadership. Unemployment for highly skilled roles remains low and employees know they have options in a tight labor market. In 2025, nearly 7 in 10 organizations (69%) reported difficulty recruiting for full-time positions despite some cooling off from the peak of the “Great Resignation” ￼. In other words, talent is in the driver’s seat. Top performers will not hesitate to leave unsatisfying environments, and poor leadership is a primary driver of that dissatisfaction.

Multiple studies reinforce that employees’ decisions to stay with or leave a company are heavily influenced by the quality of their direct managers and leaders. A landmark Gallup study famously found that “people don’t leave companies, they leave managers”, a finding that continues to hold true a decade later ￼. In an era where specialized talent can make or break organizational success, a leader who is simply “adequate” in managing and inspiring their team risks high turnover and low engagement. Conversely, leaders who foster growth, recognition, and trust can significantly boost retention, a critical advantage when skilled workers are scarce.

Employee expectations of leaders have also expanded beyond baseline managerial competence. Workers today seek leaders who communicate a compelling mission, demonstrate empathy, and support career development. This is especially true for younger generations entering the workforce with new attitudes about work. Millennials and Gen Z employees, who now comprise over half the workforce, want jobs that provide not just a paycheck but also personal fulfillment, learning, and work-life balance ￼ ￼. According to Deloitte’s 2025 survey of over 23,000 Millennial and Gen Z respondents, roughly 9 in 10 young workers say a sense of purpose is important to their job satisfaction ￼. They “don’t lack ambition,” the survey notes, but only 6% of Gen Z cite reaching a leadership position as their primary career goal, instead they prioritize flexible work arrangements, well-being, and opportunities to develop skills ￼. What they do want from leaders is guidance, inspiration, and mentorship, not just oversight of daily tasks ￼.

This represents a sea change from past decades when employees might have tolerated authoritarian bosses or opaque communication as the norm. Now, a leader who fails to connect personally with their team, or who cannot articulate how the team’s work matters in a broader context, will quickly lose the confidence of employees. In challenging times, workers expect to hear directly from leaders about where the organization is headed. If that trust and communication are missing, engagement suffers and valued employees are more likely to disengage or leave. In short, employees today expect more transparency, empathy, and inspiration from those at the top, and they will vote with their feet if leadership falls short.

### Investor and Board Scrutiny at New Highs

It’s not only employees who are demanding more; investors and corporate boards have also raised their expectations for executive leadership. With abundant capital chasing too few truly high-growth opportunities in recent years (especially in the startup and private equity arenas), investors are less patient and more proactive in pushing for leadership changes when performance falters. Even in large public companies, we’ve seen a striking rise in CEO turnover driven not by retirement but by boards actively seeking new talent. According to a Conference Board analysis, CEO turnover accelerated in 2025 to a 12.5% succession rate, up from historic lows, and this surge is “not primarily triggered by poor corporate performance”, meaning boards are replacing CEOs for a variety of strategic or forward-looking reasons, not just when a company is failing ￼. In fact, 2024 saw record CEO departures globally, with 2025 on pace to continue that trend ￼. In the first half of 2025 alone, a record 1,235 CEOs left their roles, a 12% increase over the prior year and the highest number since tracking began in 2002 ￼. Boards are clearly willing to act quickly if they believe a leader isn’t up to the challenges ahead.

What’s driving this churn? Part of it is what one leadership advisor termed the convergence of “theater and science” in CEO succession ￼. The “theater” refers to the high public profile of CEOs, media and shareholders focus intensely on the CEO’s personal success or failure, creating a climate of intense scrutiny and even celebrity around the role ￼. Under this spotlight, any misstep or perceived shortcoming can prompt shareholder agitation. Indeed, activist investors have increasingly agitated for CEO ousters: a record 27 CEOs were forced out by activist investor action in 2024, nearly triple the number just a few years prior ￼. These activists are laser-focused on total shareholder return and often swoop in if performance lags for as little as six quarters, pressuring boards to make a change ￼. In other words, investors now give CEOs roughly 18 months to prove themselves; “wait and see” is not a luxury under activist scrutiny.

The “science” side driving turnover is that boards have become far more rigorous and data-driven in evaluating what a successful leader looks like ￼. They conduct extensive due diligence on CEO candidates’ track records, leadership style, and alignment with the company’s future needs. Many boards have concluded that the skill set required of a CEO today is markedly different than in the past, and they are unafraid to pull the trigger on succession if a leader doesn’t demonstrate those needed traits. “Boards want leaders who can deliver tough messages and make difficult people decisions while maintaining trust,” notes one Boston Consulting Group analysis of CEO selection criteria ￼. In practice, boards are hunting for a rare blend of abilities, they “want candidates who hit targets and have a vision, can lead people and make hard personnel decisions, and are both humble and impressive,” as BCG found ￼. That combination of operational execution, strategic foresight, people leadership, and personal character is a tall order, and it reflects how uncompromising the expectations of top leaders have become.

It’s no surprise, then, that being a CEO in 2025 is extraordinarily challenging. As Tim Ryan, U.S. senior partner at PwC, put it: “Whether it’s inflation, rising interest rates, supply-chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, there is a lot happening in the global economy. And on top of those forces, consumer expectations are increasing, competition is intense and investors are raising the bar. There’s never been a more challenging time to be a CEO or member of senior management.” ￼. In this environment of heightened expectations, boards feel they cannot afford leaders who are anything less than excellent across multiple dimensions. The margin for error has shrunk, and “good enough” leaders are often deemed not good enough to keep their jobs. Boards and investors now seek leaders who are visionary yet accountable, decisive yet collaborative, and they are quicker to replace those who don’t measure up.

### Complex Challenges Requiring Stronger Leadership

Beyond the human-driven pressures from employees and investors, the overall complexity and volatility of the business landscape itself demand more from leaders. Compared to even a decade ago, executives must juggle far more critical issues simultaneously. McKinsey research estimates that ten years ago CEOs typically focused on four or five top strategic issues at a time; today, that number has doubled to around ten major issues competing for attention ￼. This includes managing through external shocks (pandemics, geopolitical conflicts), responding to disruptive technologies (from digitization to AI), meeting evolving customer and societal expectations (such as sustainability and social responsibility), all while delivering quarter-by-quarter financial results. The compounding and interconnected nature of these disruptions means leaders have less time to react and little room for missteps ￼ ￼.

The recent surge in macroeconomic uncertainty is a case in point. High inflation and interest rate hikes, volatile energy prices, and the specter of recession have created a fog of uncertainty around planning and forecasting. Leaders must make big bets and allocate resources amid ambiguous signals. Those who cling to a “play it safe” or status quo management style can quickly put their firms at a disadvantage. In uncertain times, stakeholders actually look to leadership for more clarity and boldness, they expect leaders to navigate uncertainty by being proactive, not paralyzed. As one observer noted, “when the outlook is uncertain and the going gets tough, you don’t change your CEO; rather you tend to wait until the economic outlook is a bit better, and then you change your CEO” ￼. In other words, boards may tolerate an incumbent during the eye of a storm, but as soon as there’s a breather, they may seek a new leader better suited for the next phase. The underlying message is that the job of CEO itself has become far more demanding, requiring the ability (as one Russell Reynolds Associates report put it) “to navigate completely unexpected events and relationships” on top of the usual complexity ￼. Leaders must manage not just their employees and shareholders, but also a widening array of stakeholders including government regulators, activist groups, and communities, all of whom have a voice in business today ￼.

In summary, the landscape in which leaders operate has fundamentally changed. Employees won’t tolerate uninspired management and will leave if their leaders disappoint them. Investors and boards won’t tolerate subpar results or strategic drift and will agitate for change swiftly. And the external business context itself is throwing curveballs that demand agile, decisive, and resilient leadership. These converging pressures have exposed the stark reality that leadership approaches once considered adequate are now painfully insufficient. The next section will delve into exactly which old behaviors and competencies are causing leaders to falter, and why evolving beyond “good enough” is now a business imperative.

## When “Good Enough” No Longer Suffices

Many of today’s leadership failures can be traced to clinging to yesterday’s playbook. Behaviors and skill sets that might have sustained a manager’s career in more predictable or forgiving times are now frequently leading to underperformance. What does “good enough” leadership look like in context? It might be the division VP who hits the bare minimum targets but lacks vision or adaptability. It could be the founder-CEO with brilliant technical ideas but poor people skills, or the seasoned manager who is competent in a stable environment but freezes amid disruption. Such leaders may have been considered serviceable, even successful, in years past. But in the high-expectation market of today, their shortcomings are exposed quickly. Here we examine several previously acceptable leadership behaviors that are now liabilities, and why they cause trouble in the modern context.

### The Cost of Complacency and Static Skills

In an environment characterized by constant change, one of the most dangerous traits in a leader is complacency, a belief that what worked before will continue to work now. A decade ago, a leader might have built a career on a narrow expertise or a single successful strategy, then ridden that playbook for years. Today, that approach is untenable. Industries are being upended by new technologies and business models at a blistering pace. Leaders who fail to continuously learn and broaden their skills risk leading their organizations into stagnation or irrelevance. McKinsey’s research on 21st-century leadership emphasizes that continuous learning and a humble mindset are essential traits for modern leaders ￼. The highest-performing leaders “never consider themselves to be the smartest person in the room” and are willing to admit what they don’t know, seek diverse views, and learn from mistakes ￼. In contrast, the once-typical leader who operated as a “know-it-all” or relied solely on past experience now finds that approach falling short. Problems emerge that they haven’t seen before, whether it’s adopting a new AI tool or responding to sudden shifts in consumer behavior, and an inflexible leader can quickly become overwhelmed.

A static skill set also undermines a leader’s credibility with teams that are themselves trying to adapt. For example, if a leader shows little fluency in digital technology, younger employees, who expect their leaders to at least understand the tech that shapes the business, will question that leader’s relevance. We’ve seen cases of retail CEOs or media executives who underestimated the impact of e-commerce or streaming platforms, only to see their companies overtaken by more forward-thinking competitors. In contrast, adaptive leaders who show personal growth send a powerful message to their organization: that learning and innovation are valued at the top. Microsoft’s CEO Satya Nadella famously shifted the company culture by modeling a “learn-it-all” attitude rather than a know-it-all attitude, encouraging everyone to stay curious and adaptable ￼. Leaders stuck in old paradigms fail to inspire this, and their companies risk falling behind. In short, what was once a satisfactory level of expertise can now quickly become obsolete, and “good enough” leaders who stop learning soon aren’t good enough for the business either.

### Overreliance on Authority and Micromanagement

Another outdated behavior is the command-and-control leadership style that was common in the 20th century. In years past, especially in rigid corporate hierarchies, a “good” manager was often defined by their control over decisions and tight oversight of subordinates. Delegation and empowerment were rarer; managers were expected to have all the answers and direct their teams accordingly. Today, that model has flipped. The complexity of modern business means no leader can single-handedly micromanage every decision, nor should they try, given that innovation and speed often come from empowering those closest to the information. Leaders who continue to micromanage and stifle team autonomy are seeing poor results: slower decision cycles, demoralized employees, and an inability to adapt quickly.

Research and experience show that front-line empowerment leads to better performance, especially in fast-changing situations. This is akin to the military concept of mission command which we discuss in the next section, the idea that leaders must give their people clear objectives and the freedom to execute. Organizations embracing agile and adaptable structures explicitly push decision-making down to empowered teams. Deloitte finds that “adaptable organizations place greater emphasis on the team and unlock individual performance through team composition and new ways of working,” prioritizing informal networks over rigid hierarchies ￼ ￼. High-performing teams are given “as much freedom and accountability as possible” ￼. For a leader raised on strict command-and-control, such freedom can feel uncomfortable, and granting accountability to others may feel like losing grip. But not doing so can be worse. Many companies have discovered that a manager who bottlenecks decisions or requires constant sign-off is actually a liability now. Opportunities are missed while staff await approval, and talented team members grow frustrated at the lack of trust.

Furthermore, the shift to remote and hybrid work (covered in detail later) has laid bare the inefficiency of micromanagement. Leaders who relied on line-of-sight supervision struggled when teams went virtual. Those who insisted on excessive status checks or surveillance software created resentment, as employees interpreted it as lack of trust. By contrast, leaders who set clear goals and then trusted people to meet them, focusing on outcomes rather than keystrokes, have generally found their teams to be more productive and engaged in a hybrid environment. The old norm of measuring a leader by how “in control” they appear is being replaced by measuring leaders by how well they enable and empower their teams. An authoritarian style that might have been tolerated before is now often a direct cause of underperformance: it drives attrition of top talent and slows the organization’s responsiveness.

### Avoidance of Accountability and Tough Calls

In times when businesses were growing steadily, it was possible for a leader to succeed while avoiding the hardest aspects of accountability, for instance, glossing over underperforming units, keeping marginal team members to avoid conflict, or blaming external factors for misses. Mediocre leaders could sometimes “hide” in a rising tide. That is no longer the case. With pressure on results from all sides, leaders are expected to confront problems head-on and make difficult decisions in a timely manner. A failure to do so is now glaringly obvious and much less acceptable to stakeholders. For example, if a team or executive is underperforming, boards and investors expect the CEO to address it decisively, be it through coaching, reassigning roles, or exit, rather than let the issue fester. BCG’s recent study of board expectations noted that “Boards want leaders who can deliver tough messages and make difficult people decisions while maintaining trust. The best leader can create belief and momentum from discomfort.” ￼. Leaders who shrink from difficult conversations or delay painful decisions (perhaps out of a misguided desire to be liked, or fear of rocking the boat) may think they are maintaining short-term harmony, but they are undermining long-term performance and trust. In today’s climate, avoiding accountability is seen as a failure of leadership itself.

Moreover, leaders now have nowhere to hide when things go wrong. In the age of social media and instant information, accountability is often played out in the public eye. We routinely see CEOs apologizing for scandals or missteps on a global stage, and employees and customers expect genuine accountability and course correction. Leaders who used to deflect blame or offer corporate-speak excuses find that such approaches backfire quickly now, damaging their credibility. Instead, a posture of “extreme ownership”, openly taking responsibility for setbacks and committing to solutions, is increasingly respected. This idea, popularized by former Navy SEAL Jocko Willink, echoes the military ethos that a leader is responsible for everything under their command. While our focus is not on any one individual philosophy, the core concept is widely applicable: when leaders own problems, they can fix them; when they dodge responsibility, problems compound.

An example can be seen in performance management. In the past, a manager might tolerate a chronically underperforming employee indefinitely, hoping things improve. Now we know this is devastating for team morale, “if you don’t address poor performance, your best people will find a leader who will,” as one leadership coach noted ￼. Tolerating mediocrity for the sake of avoiding confrontation is a cardinal sin in a high-expectation environment. The cascading effect is that high performers feel unfairly burdened or unrecognized, and they may leave (again reflecting the maxim that people leave when leaders fail to lead). Thus, a “good enough” leader who is lax on accountability may inadvertently drive away the very team members who could have lifted performance. By contrast, leaders who tackle issues promptly, albeit with fairness and empathy, set a standard that can actually increase loyalty among strong performers, who see that leadership upholds merit and integrity.

### Lack of Vision and Adaptability

It used to be that a competent caretaker leader could have a decent run simply by keeping the operations ticking and making incremental improvements. Many managers prided themselves on being efficient administrators rather than big-picture thinkers. In the current market, however, leaders are expected to provide vision and navigate change, not just steward the status quo. Underperformance often stems from leaders being reactive instead of proactive, essentially playing not to lose, rather than playing to win. When the environment shifts (be it a new technology, a new competitor, or a sudden change in customer preference), a merely “adequate” leader might hesitate, waiting for more information or for someone else to take the first leap. By the time they respond, it may be too late. High-expectation stakeholders interpret that hesitancy as poor leadership. Indeed, McKinsey’s Organizational Health Index finds that companies with leaders who act decisively and commit to decisions are 4.2 times more likely to be healthy organizations in the long run ￼. In other words, even an imperfect decision made promptly and with conviction can be better than paralysis or constant second-guessing.

A lack of adaptive vision is particularly problematic given the rapid disruption across industries. Consider how many once-dominant firms have stumbled in recent years because their leaders failed to anticipate the next wave. Whether it was a retailer misjudging the shift to online shopping, or a telecom CEO underestimating the rise of mobile computing, these misreads often came from leaders who were executing yesterday’s plan well, but only that. Today’s successful leaders are constantly scanning the horizon and encouraging innovation. An average leader might view innovation as a side project or something to worry about later; a high-performance leader makes it central to strategy. They articulate a vision of where the company needs to go and mobilize the organization toward it, even if that means disrupting their own current business. This requires comfort with ambiguity and risk, qualities not traditionally expected of middle managers, but very much expected of top leaders now.

Finally, underperformance can result from a misalignment of values and culture. In the past, a leader could succeed by focusing narrowly on financial metrics and enforcing compliance. But newer generations of employees, as well as customers and society at large, care about a broader set of values (ethical behavior, diversity and inclusion, sustainability, etc.). A “good enough” leader of the old school might dismiss these concerns or handle them superficially, only to find themselves facing internal disengagement or external criticism. For example, a CEO who pays lip service to diversity but makes no real changes may lose credibility with employees who expect genuine inclusive leadership. Or a leader who is tone-deaf to work-life balance may drive attrition in a workforce that increasingly prioritizes mental health. In this sense, behaviors that used to be overlooked, such as a gruff management style, or ignoring employee well-being, now directly contribute to leadership failure. Modern leadership requires a higher emotional intelligence and awareness of cultural expectations. Leaders must embody the values they preach and build trust through authenticity. Those who cannot do so often “fall short” in the eyes of a workforce that has no qualms calling out inauthenticity.

In sum, the competencies that once sufficed, a steady managerial hand, basic people management, incremental improvement, are not enough against the challenges businesses face today. The leadership gap is evident in many organizations: the world changed, but many leaders have not changed quickly enough. Bridging that gap may require looking at leadership through a new lens, which is where models from high-performing institutions like the U.S. military can provide inspiration. Before turning to business-specific solutions for talent, hybrid work, and so on, we will explore how military leadership principles offer a framework for the level of leadership excellence now demanded in the corporate realm.

## Lessons from Military Leadership: A Model for High-Performance

When seeking models of leadership that excel under pressure and uncertainty, the practices of the U.S. military are often cited with good reason. Military organizations have been in the business of leadership development far longer than the corporate world and have refined methods to select and shape leaders capable of operating in life-or-death situations ￼. While business is not warfare, modern companies do operate in high-stakes, fast-changing environments that share parallels with military contexts. Principles such as mission command, rigorous accountability, and adaptability are cornerstones of military leadership doctrine, and they map closely to what high-performing businesses need from leaders today.

It’s worth clarifying that adopting military principles does not mean adopting a top-down “militaristic” culture, in fact, quite the opposite. The particular military philosophies we highlight emphasize empowerment, clarity of purpose, and agile thinking, rather than bureaucracy or blind obedience. Many forward-thinking companies and leadership experts have already integrated lessons from military leadership into executive training programs ￼. Below, we discuss three key concepts and how they translate into a model of high-performance leadership in the corporate world.

### Mission Command: Clarity of Intent and Decentralized Execution

One of the most powerful military leadership philosophies relevant to business is mission command. This approach was developed and practiced by the U.S. Army (as well as other militaries) to enable effective action in the fog of war when communication is limited and subordinate leaders must make decisions on the fly. The core idea of mission command is that commanders should issue a clear intent, a compelling picture of the mission’s objective and the purpose behind it, but give their subordinates wide latitude in how they achieve that objective. In practical terms: tell people what needs to be accomplished and why, but not necessarily how to do it. This contrasts sharply with traditional “command and control” where a leader micromanages and dictates each step. Mission command instead entrusts well-trained team members to exercise initiative and adapt in alignment with the commander’s intent.

Translated to a business setting, mission command is about empowering teams with clarity and trust. Leaders articulate a clear vision or goal (the “mission”) and the reasons it matters, and ensure everyone understands the direction. Then, rather than hovering over execution, leaders allow teams and individuals to use their expertise and creativity to carry out tasks as they see fit, intervening only when necessary to align with the broader intent. This philosophy has proven to be a force multiplier in business as in the military. A Harvard Business Review analysis of military leadership lessons highlighted the importance of “convey[ing] strategic intent. Make the objectives clear, but give people the freedom to execute on them in their own way.” ￼. When people have ownership of the how, they are more invested and often find better solutions than a top-down approach would dictate.

For example, a CEO practicing mission command might set a strategic objective like “Improve our customer satisfaction to industry-leading levels because we want to be known for service excellence” and explain the value (customer loyalty, brand strength). Instead of handing down a detailed plan, the CEO empowers department heads and front-line teams to implement changes, whether that’s revamping support processes, offering new training, or other innovations, so long as those efforts serve the overarching mission of delighting customers. Teams on the ground, being closer to the customer, can iterate and adjust tactics quickly without waiting for permission. The CEO periodically checks alignment with the intent and ensures resources and obstacles are addressed, but does not micromanage each team’s method.

The benefits of mission command in business include greater agility and resilience. Because decisions are made by those closest to the information, the organization can respond to changes faster. If a new competitor moves into the market or a crisis occurs, empowered teams can act in real-time rather than freezing until the CEO formulates a directive. It also boosts morale and talent development, employees feel trusted to use their judgment, which increases their engagement and grows their leadership skills. A recent analysis by consulting firm Kearney noted that with a mission-command approach, “leaders encourage their team members to trust their own abilities and come to their own conclusions” in executing the mission ￼. That kind of trust-based empowerment is exactly what today’s skilled professionals (especially younger ones) crave from their leaders, and it tends to unlock their best performance.

Of course, mission command does not mean laissez-faire leadership or abdicating responsibility. It requires leaders to invest heavily in communication and training upfront. Subordinates must clearly understand the leader’s intent and have the competence to execute independently. This aligns with the idea of “meet the troops”, a lesson from military leadership that emphasizes creating personal links and mutual trust between leaders and their people ￼. In business, leaders practicing mission command spend time aligning their team on vision and values, so that when decisions are decentralized, everyone is guided by a shared “commander’s intent.” Companies like Amazon have implicitly used this concept by pushing decision-making down to the most informed levels, guided by clear principles (for instance, Amazon’s leadership principles act as an intent that helps employees make calls in the spirit of customer obsession).

In summary, mission command is the antidote to the rigidity that causes “good enough” leaders to fail. It replaces micromanagement with empowerment and replaces ambiguity with clarity of purpose. As one Army publication succinctly defines it: “Mission command is the exercise of authority and direction by the commander using mission orders to enable disciplined initiative.” In the corporate realm, adopting mission command means leaders focus on setting direction and context, the why and what, and then trust their teams to execute, adapt, and innovate within that framework. It is a model well-suited for the remote/hybrid work era and for any fast-paced knowledge industry where creativity and responsiveness are key.

### Accountability and Extreme Ownership

The U.S. military is also known for its uncompromising culture of accountability, a trait that is increasingly prized in business leaders. In the military, accountability starts at the very top: commanders are responsible for everything their unit does or fails to do. This doesn’t mean they personally perform every task, but they own the outcomes. If a mission fails, a military leader is expected to take responsibility, learn what went wrong, and fix it, not make excuses or shift blame. This ethos of accountability cascades down, creating a culture where each person understands their responsibility to the mission and to each other. Teams debrief after missions in candid after-action reviews, identifying mistakes without fear so they can improve. Such practices build a norm where accountability is about improving performance and honoring trust, not about punishment or scapegoating.

In a business context, instilling a similar culture of accountability can drive high performance. Leaders who embrace “extreme ownership” (to borrow the term popularized by a Navy SEAL turned consultant) set the tone by publicly owning up to shortfalls and actively pursuing solutions. This encourages employees to also take initiative and responsibility in their roles. By contrast, leaders who deflect blame or tolerate a lack of accountability among their team create a culture of finger-pointing and inaction. As noted earlier, failing to address underperformance or tough issues erodes a team’s faith in its leader. High-expectation environments have little patience for that. Employees respect leaders who hold themselves and others to high standards, and importantly, who pair accountability with support. In the military, if someone is underperforming, a good leader will both hold them accountable and ensure they get the training or mentorship needed to improve. The same principle can apply in companies: rather than quietly reassigning a struggling executive and hoping for the best, a strong leader will address the issue head-on, set clear performance expectations, and provide the resources or coaching for that leader to grow (or make the hard call if they cannot).

Accountability in modern business leadership also extends to ethical and societal dimensions. Military leaders are drilled in values like integrity because in the fog of war, ethical shortcuts can have dire consequences. In business, we have seen how leaders who fail to take accountability for ethical lapses or who brush aside stakeholder concerns can quickly fall from grace. Today’s CEOs are expected to be accountable not just for profits, but for company culture and reputation. For example, if a toxic work environment issue comes to light, stakeholders increasingly demand that leadership accepts responsibility and takes corrective action, rather than dismissing it as “a few bad apples.” A survey by Deloitte finds that employees’ trust and confidence in business is at historic lows in recent years ￼, partly due to repeated scandals and failures of leadership accountability. The way to rebuild that trust is through leaders consistently demonstrating accountability, saying “the buck stops here” and meaning it.

The combination of freedom and accountability is particularly powerful. Going back to mission command, it only works when those given freedom also embrace accountability for results. Deloitte’s research on adaptable organizations notes that high-performing teams have as much freedom and accountability as possible ￼. This ensures that empowerment does not lead to chaos; everyone knows they are accountable for their piece of the mission. A concrete practice some companies use is to clearly document “owners” for key objectives or metrics, so it’s transparent who is responsible for what outcomes. But more than a checklist, it’s a mindset: leaders at all levels take initiative to fix problems when they see them, rather than saying “not my job.” That mindset has to start with the example set by the top leader.

In adopting a military-like accountability ethos, business leaders should foster an environment where candor and feedback are encouraged. Military units regularly conduct debriefs where even the leader’s decisions are scrutinized by the team in pursuit of learning. This might be unfamiliar in corporate cultures where bad news is softened or bosses aren’t challenged. However, instituting more rigorous post-mortems on projects and inviting constructive dissent can significantly improve organizational learning and performance. It signals that the goal is to get better, not to assign blame, which paradoxically increases individual ownership since people see that admitting mistakes is safe and leads to improvement.

The bottom line is that accountability is a hallmark of high-expectation leadership. Leaders must hold themselves accountable to the organization’s mission and values, and equally hold their teams accountable to high performance and ethical standards. By doing so, they build credibility with boards (who see that the leader “owns” results) and with employees (who see that mediocrity or misconduct won’t be swept under the rug). This kind of trust is a foundation for long-term success. In contrast, the “good enough” leader who avoids accountability breeds mediocrity, exactly what no company can afford now.

### Adaptability, Resilience, and Continuous Improvement

The third military principle vital for business leaders is adaptability, the capacity to adjust rapidly to new circumstances and to innovate on the fly. Military history is replete with examples of plans going awry once the battle begins (as the saying goes, “no plan survives first contact with the enemy”). Thus, military leaders are trained not only to plan meticulously, but also to improvise and adapt when conditions change. Flexibility is not seen as a lack of discipline, but as a necessary trait to seize opportunity or avoid catastrophe. Modern armed forces emphasize developing leaders who are comfortable being uncomfortable, who can provide direction amidst uncertainty and make decisions with incomplete information. They also institutionalize learning mechanisms (like after-action reviews mentioned above) to adapt tactics and strategies continuously.

Businesses today face their own never-ending onslaught of change, from market disruptions to global crises, making adaptability a critical leadership trait. A McKinsey analysis bluntly noted that “complicated times demand great leaders” and highlighted grit and resilience as key qualities: the best leaders are “stoic in the face of disruption”, assimilate new information, and make tough decisions without wavering ￼. We saw during the COVID-19 pandemic that some companies pivoted successfully (retooling factories, shifting to digital channels, etc.) while others faltered; a major differentiator was the adaptability of leadership. Leaders who quickly accepted reality, showed resilience, and rallied their teams to innovate had far better outcomes than those who panicked or clung to pre-COVID strategies. The lesson carries forward: in any scenario of rapid change, be it an economic downturn, a technological breakthrough, or a sudden regulatory shift, leaders must be the most adaptable element of the organization. If the leader resists change, the whole organization will likely lag.

Adaptive leadership also means being proactive about continuous improvement. Military units don’t wait for a crisis to adapt; they constantly train in different scenarios and update their tactics. Similarly, business leaders should foster a culture of ongoing experimentation and learning. “Leadership for uncertain and turbulent times demands…the capacity to learn and adapt,” notes one business leadership report ￼. This might involve running pilot programs for new innovations, encouraging employees at all levels to suggest improvements (and actually trying their ideas), and remaining agile in strategic planning (e.g., using scenario planning and contingency plans rather than a static five-year plan). A leader who is stuck in a rigid annual planning mindset, or who punishes failure harshly, will struggle to cultivate adaptability. By contrast, a leader who is open-minded, curious, and not afraid to course-correct sets the tone for a nimble organization.

The U.S. military’s concept of “commander’s intent” (part of mission command) is itself a tool for adaptability, because subordinates know the intent, if the situation changes and communications are down, they can adapt their actions to still achieve the intent. Businesses saw a parallel during the sudden shift to remote work in 2020: those whose leaders had clearly communicated company values and goals found that employees could make appropriate decisions from home without constant oversight, whereas organizations without that clarity floundered. Adaptable organizations champion adaptive leaders at every level. Deloitte observes that such leaders “embrace vulnerability” and empower their teams to be successful amid change ￼. They shift from “telling to inspiring,” acknowledge when they don’t have all the answers, and encourage collaborative problem-solving ￼. This inclusiveness and humility actually strengthen a leader’s ability to adapt, because it brings in more perspectives and fosters innovation.

A striking example of adaptability from the military world with business application is the OODA loop (Observe–Orient–Decide–Act) developed by Air Force Colonel John Boyd. It’s a decision-making framework that emphasizes rapid iteration: continually observe the environment, orient (make sense of it), decide on a course, act, and then repeat as the situation evolves. Many tech companies implicitly use such agile loops to iterate products and strategies. Leaders who push their organizations to move and learn in fast cycles are channeling this adaptive ethos. The days of a slow, conservative annual review cycle are fading; in many sectors, the environment will have shifted by the time a slow decision is made. Thus, leaders must both make timely decisions (even without perfect info) and be ready to pivot as new info emerges. The military’s mantra of “adapt and overcome” could well be every modern CEO’s mantra too.

Incorporating military-style adaptability does not mean being reckless or constantly changing course on a whim. It means being prepared for multiple scenarios, staying calm under pressure, and not becoming overly attached to one plan. Leaders can cultivate this by stress-testing their strategies (“pre-mortems” for projects to imagine what could go wrong), encouraging a diversity of viewpoints to avoid groupthink, and drilling a mindset that mistakes are opportunities to learn rather than reasons for denial.

To tie these principles together: a high-performance leader in today’s mold will set a clear mission, empower the team to execute, hold themselves and others accountable for results and values, and continually adapt and learn. These are precisely the leadership behaviors that the best military units instill and that businesses must now instill as well. Companies such as Johnson & Johnson and General Electric have famously incorporated military leadership training in their executive programs for decades ￼, focusing on lessons like decisive decision-making and purpose-driven leadership. In the next sections, we will apply these principles, mission command, accountability, adaptability, to the specific challenges of talent management, remote work, generational shifts, economic uncertainty, and technological disruption. The goal is to illustrate concretely how a leader operating at this higher standard can navigate each of these modern challenges, whereas a “good enough” leader would likely stumble.

## Meeting Modern Challenges with High-Expectation Leadership

Having explored the general mindset and principles that distinguish high-performing leaders, we now turn to the practical challenges facing organizations today. Each of the following areas, talent scarcity, remote/hybrid work, generational change, economic uncertainty, and technological disruption, has become a defining test for leaders. In each case, the behaviors of “good enough” leaders are being exposed as inadequate, while those of exceptional leaders shine. By examining each challenge in turn, we can highlight the contrast and demonstrate why elevating leadership is not a theoretical exercise but a pressing strategic need. We also provide insights on how leaders can leverage the principles discussed (mission, accountability, adaptability, etc.) to surmount these challenges.

### Talent Scarcity and Retention: Leadership as a Magnet (or Repellent)

It is no exaggeration to say we are in the midst of a talent war across many industries. Unemployment rates for high-skill roles remain low, and critical fields like technology, healthcare, and engineering face shortages of qualified candidates. Even where there is no absolute labor shortage, the balance of power has shifted toward employees who are more willing to change jobs for better opportunities. In this climate, the ability to attract and retain top talent has become a key differentiator between companies, and that ability hinges largely on leadership.

A mediocre or “good enough” leader might assume that people will stay in their jobs for pay or stability, and that recruitment is mainly an HR responsibility unrelated to day-to-day leadership. But evidence shows leadership quality has a direct impact on a company’s talent pipeline. As noted earlier, around 69% of organizations in 2025 report difficulties in recruiting for full-time positions ￼. This difficulty persists even after the pandemic disruptions, indicating structural talent challenges. Why do some firms still manage to hire great people? Often, it’s because talented candidates are drawn to inspiring leaders and strong company cultures. Similarly, when valued employees leave, exit interviews and surveys frequently cite dissatisfaction with management or lack of growth as top reasons, even above compensation in many cases.

Great leadership can be a magnet for talent. Leaders who are known for nurturing employees’ careers, championing innovation, and maintaining a positive, inclusive culture develop an employer brand that draws in high performers. For example, consider how the leadership style of Satya Nadella changed perceptions of Microsoft: under the prior regime, Microsoft had a reputation for internal competition and stagnation, which made some talent shun it. Nadella’s focus on growth mindset, empathy, and collaboration not only improved results but also made Microsoft a more attractive place for tech talent to work, helping to lure experts in AI and cloud computing that were pivotal to its transformation ￼. This illustrates how a leader’s approach sends a powerful signal to the labor market.

Conversely, “good enough” leaders often become talent repellents. This can happen in subtle ways. If a leader does not prioritize developing their people, top performers will feel their careers are stalling and look elsewhere. If a leader tolerates poor team dynamics or doesn’t address toxic behavior, great employees won’t stick around in that environment. If a leader fails to recognize and reward exceptional work (perhaps thinking “no news is good news”), the high achievers will feel undervalued. All of these scenarios lead to regrettable turnover. And in a world where platforms like Glassdoor and LinkedIn make workplace culture more transparent, a company can quickly gain a bad reputation among job-seekers if leadership issues go unaddressed. For instance, a spate of negative reviews saying “senior management doesn’t listen to employees” or “no work-life balance, burnout culture” will significantly hamper recruiting, and those comments almost always reflect leadership failures upstream.

One of the simplest yet most impactful leadership actions for retention is investing in front-line managers. The front-line manager embodies the company’s leadership for most employees on a daily basis. As HBR reported, citing Gallup, the single biggest factor in retention is the quality of the immediate manager ￼. Organizations that identify their best managers and give them support and development see a multiplier effect on employee engagement and tenure. This is why some forward-looking companies are channeling extra training and resources to management coaching, recognizing that an employee’s experience is largely shaped by how their leader behaves. A survey from McKinsey corroborated this, finding organizations with psychologically safe climates (a product of good leadership) were more likely to innovate quickly and had better performance ￼. The takeaway is clear: leaders at all levels must be equipped to meet employees’ needs for feedback, recognition, and growth, or the company will bleed talent. In a high-expectation market, average leaders simply won’t cut it, because employees will leave for a better boss.

So how can leaders adopt a high-performance approach to talent retention? First, by fostering a genuine people-centric culture. This doesn’t mean coddling or avoiding hard truths; it means showing employees that leadership cares about their development and well-being. Simple practices like regular one-on-one career conversations, personal acknowledgment of milestones, and clear pathways for advancement can significantly improve retention, according to research by SHRM and others ￼ ￼. Second, by creating an environment of recognition and meritocracy. High performers are more likely to stay if they see that contributions are noticed and rewarded, and that underperformance is addressed (again linking to accountability). A leader should celebrate team wins publicly and give credit where it’s due. When people feel “seen” by leadership, their loyalty increases.

Additionally, effective leaders today actively engage in succession planning and upskilling for their teams. They identify rising stars and give them stretch opportunities, showing that the company offers a future for them. This addresses a major reason employees, especially younger ones, quit: lack of advancement. If a “good enough” leader is just keeping things running, they might neglect this forward-looking aspect and be blindsided when a key employee leaves for a growth opportunity elsewhere. By contrast, a proactive leader will, for example, pair a junior high-potential employee with a mentor, or involve them in strategic projects beyond their role. This aligns with what Deloitte’s Millennial Survey found: learning and development is one of the top reasons Gen Z and Millennial employees choose to work for their employer ￼. If your leadership culture provides that learning, you attract those ambitious employees; if not, they slip away.

Finally, leadership plays a critical role at the hiring stage. In a tight labor market, candidates often decide based on the impression made by prospective bosses during interviews. A leader who can compellingly share the team’s vision, who asks thoughtful questions, and who demonstrates respect for the candidate can win over a talented person who has multiple offers. On the flip side, we’ve all heard of candidates rejecting an offer due to a poor interaction with a hiring manager or executive (“I didn’t like the boss’s vibe” is a fatal verdict). Especially for executive hires, boards and investors must consider how a candidate’s leadership style will affect the company’s talent magnetism. An executive might have a great CV, but if their leadership approach is outdated or uninspiring, the cost in talent loss could outweigh whatever operational skill they bring.

In sum, talent is the ultimate currency, and leadership quality is one of the most important factors determining whether that currency flows in or out of an organization. The high-expectation market means employees won’t tolerate subpar leadership, they will leave, and it’s easier than ever for them to find new opportunities (often with remote work expanding geographic options). Companies can no longer assume that a decent salary will retain people in spite of mediocre managers. Instead, great leadership is becoming a strategic asset in winning the talent war, and organizations must cultivate and hire leaders who can deliver an employee experience that keeps the best people on board.

**Figure:** In a 2025 survey, 69% of organizations reported difficulty recruiting for full-time roles, a sign of persistent talent scarcity in the labor market ￼. Leadership quality directly impacts a company’s ability to attract candidates in such a tight market. Firms that offer inspiring leadership and growth opportunities are more likely to stand out to job seekers, whereas those with reputations for poor management may struggle to fill roles.

### Leading a Remote and Hybrid Workforce: Trust and Mission in Action

Perhaps no shift has tested traditional leadership paradigms as much as the rise of remote and hybrid work. What started as a pandemic necessity has solidified into an enduring feature of the employment landscape. Surveys of executives indicate that hybrid and fully remote work are expected to continue growing over the next five years, not revert to pre-2020 norms ￼ ￼. Leaders find themselves managing distributed teams across homes, offices, and time zones, requiring a recalibration of how to maintain productivity, culture, and cohesion. In this arena, leaders who rely on old habits, like judging performance by “face time” in the office, or hoarding information at the top, are discovering that they quickly lose effectiveness. By contrast, leaders who lean into trust, clarity, and results-oriented management are thriving with remote teams.

A fundamental element of remote leadership is trust. In a co-located office, a controlling leader might get by through sheer physical presence (peering over shoulders, holding frequent check-in meetings, etc.). But remote work strips those crutches away. A “good enough” leader uncomfortable with trust might attempt to compensate by instituting excessive monitoring of remote employees, for instance, requiring constant status reports or using surveillance software to track keystrokes. These approaches almost always backfire. Employees resent the implied lack of trust and often experience higher stress and lower morale. The end result can be a decline in loyalty and productivity, the very opposite of what the leader intended.

Research indicates that employees deeply value the autonomy and flexibility that remote work affords, to the point that many view it as equivalent to a significant pay raise. One study found that working from home is valued by employees about the same as an 8% salary increase, on average ￼. Moreover, when employees have the flexibility of remote or hybrid arrangements, it can reduce turnover by as much as 35% according to a large-scale analysis ￼. These data send a clear message: leaders should treat remote work not as a temporary perk to be begrudged, but as a lasting feature to be optimized. Leaders who insist on full-time office returns without a compelling reason, or who frequently change their stance on remote policies, risk demotivating their workforce and losing talent to more flexible competitors. We’ve seen high-profile cases of companies issuing strict return-to-office mandates only to face employee backlash or spikes in attrition, particularly in tech sectors where workers have leverage.

So what does high-performance leadership look like in a hybrid world? It looks a lot like mission command in practice. With teams distributed, leaders must excel at communicating the mission (goals, priorities, and context) and then empowering employees to execute independently. Setting clear expectations and outcomes is critical, every team member should know what they need to deliver and why it matters. When that understanding is in place, leaders can grant broad flexibility on the how and when. For example, instead of monitoring hours online, a sales leader might define the targets and metrics for a quarter, provide the necessary tools, and then trust reps to manage their schedules to meet those targets, checking in on progress periodically. As long as results are delivered, the focus is on output, not process. This shift to managing by outcomes rather than by observation is a hallmark of successful remote leadership. It ties back to providing commander’s intent, the team knows the objective and has latitude to achieve it.

Communication also takes on heightened importance. Leaders must create regular touchpoints that are meaningful, not perfunctory. This might include a weekly video call to align on priorities, virtual “open office hours” for anyone to drop in with questions, and frequent updates on company news to avoid remote staff feeling in the dark. Importantly, communication should be two-way; listening is even more crucial when leaders can’t rely on hallway chats to take the pulse. Good remote leaders proactively solicit feedback and check on their team’s well-being. For instance, asking “How is our process working for you? Anything you need?” or “How are you managing your workload, any risks I should be aware of?” shows support and uncovers issues early. A mediocre leader might assume silence means all is well, whereas an attentive leader knows to probe gently and ensure no one is drifting into disengagement or burnout unseen.

Another aspect is inclusive culture-building at a distance. Remote and hybrid setups can inadvertently create silos or divisions (e.g., between those in-office versus fully remote). Leaders need to work creatively to unite the team. This could mean instituting rituals like virtual team huddles or remote social events, making sure recognition is given publicly across channels, and ensuring remote members have equal access to career opportunities and visibility. One practical tip many high-performing remote teams use: when even one person is remote in a meeting, everyone joins the meeting via their own screen (even if some are in office) to level the playing field in discussions. Such norms have to be championed by leaders to prevent remote colleagues from becoming second-class citizens.

Technology adoption is another area where leadership counts. Remote teams depend on collaboration tools, video conferencing, project management software, chat platforms, and so forth. Leaders don’t need to be IT experts, but they should model openness to using these tools effectively and encourage their teams to leverage them. Something as simple as a CEO actively participating in an enterprise social network or regularly responding on team Slack channels can signal that leadership is engaged and accessible, bridging the distance gap. On the flip side, a leader who rarely appears on video or is slow to respond to messages may seem aloof or create bottlenecks, causing remote employees to feel disconnected.

Ultimately, effective remote leadership comes down to combining trust with accountability. You give trust by default, assume your people want to do great work and will manage their time responsibly, and you reinforce accountability by measuring what gets done and providing support or intervention only as needed. Many companies have found that when done right, hybrid arrangements have no net negative effect on productivity, and can even increase it, while saving costs on real estate and improving employee satisfaction ￼ ￼. A Harvard Business Review piece notes that “on average, hybrid work seems to have little net effect on productivity and may increase it”, especially since employees save time (and stress) from less commuting ￼. That said, remote work isn’t a panacea, it suits some tasks and people better than others, but a leader’s job is to harness the benefits while mitigating downsides like isolation or miscommunication.

One risk is that remote arrangements can mask problems for a while. An disengaged employee, for example, might “fly under the radar” longer if a leader isn’t paying attention, since casual interactions are fewer. This again underscores why leaders must be intentional in checking in and observing performance indicators, not just assuming all is well. When performance issues do surface, a strong leader addresses them with the same clarity and fairness as in person, maybe even more promptly to prevent drift. The conversation might be via video instead of across a desk, but the principles of clear expectations and mutual problem-solving remain.

As remote and hybrid work become permanent parts of business, organizations will increasingly sort themselves into those that lead remote teams well and those that struggle. Employees certainly notice the difference. The labor market has already seen candidates favor companies with flexible work options and enlightened approaches to remote management. A blunt way to put it: a “good enough” leader who yearns for the old days of everyone in-office and under direct supervision might succeed at pulling their team back in, only to see resignations and difficulty hiring new talent who expect flexibility. On the other hand, a leader who embraces the hybrid model and excels at it will not only keep their current team happier but also widen the talent pool (since they can hire beyond geographic constraints). As Nicholas Bloom and co-authors wrote in HBR, “employees will gravitate to firms with more flexible policies” ￼. In a high-expectation market, that means leaders should view remote capability as a competitive advantage to be developed, not a temporary inconvenience. The military principle of “adapt to terrain” resonates here, the workplace terrain changed, and leaders must adapt their style accordingly, or risk being outflanked by those who do.

### Generational Change: Aligning Leadership with New Workforce Values

The entrance of Millennials and Generation Z into the workforce, and into leadership roles themselves, is reshaping workplace culture and expectations in profound ways. This generational shift is more than just a demographic trend; it’s a catalyst that is forcing companies to revisit what effective leadership looks like. Younger workers tend to have different attitudes toward authority, career, and life than many Baby Boomers and Gen X did at the same age. They generally expect more transparency, purpose, and personalization from their employers. In turn, they respond best to leadership styles that differ from the traditional command-and-control or strictly hierarchical modes.

For “good enough” leaders who grew up in the old school, these expectations can be bewildering or even threatening. We’ve all heard the clichéd complaints: “These young people need constant feedback,” “They don’t want to pay their dues,” “They expect a trophy just for showing up.” While such caricatures are exaggerated, they hint at real differences. Yes, Millennial and Gen Z employees do desire frequent feedback, but that’s because they seek to learn and grow rapidly, not because they’re needy or narcissistic. And they do value work-life balance more openly, but that’s often a reaction to seeing older generations burn out or prioritize work over family, a trade-off they’re less willing to make. The onus is on leaders to understand the values and motivations of the newer generations and adapt their leadership approach accordingly, rather than dismiss those values. Those who don’t will find themselves unable to retain or fully engage roughly two-thirds of their workforce in the coming years.

Consider career progression and motivation. Deloitte’s Global 2025 Gen Z and Millennial Survey uncovered a nuanced picture: these young professionals are ambitious and prioritize career growth, yet many are not motivated by reaching leadership positions in the traditional sense ￼ ￼. Only 6% of Gen Z respondents said becoming a top leader (executive role) was their primary goal, whereas a far greater number emphasized learning opportunities, interesting work, and making an impact as their definitions of success ￼. This suggests that dangling a fancy title or corner office (the old carrot of climbing the ladder) is less effective with this cohort. They want leadership from their bosses that focuses on coaching, skill-building, and creating meaningful work experiences, not just promotions. A savvy leader will tap into this by, for instance, connecting the team’s daily tasks to a larger mission or impact (providing that sense of meaning), and by frequently discussing development goals. An out-of-touch leader might still assume “if they’re not complaining, they must be happy,” but in reality the younger employee might be silently disengaging because no one is talking to them about their future or how the work connects to their ideals.

Purpose and values are huge for these generations. Nearly 90% of Gen Z and 92% of Millennials said that a sense of purpose is important to their job satisfaction and well-being ￼. They want to know that the organization’s mission aligns with their own values, or at least that it contributes something positive to society or at minimum does no harm. This doesn’t mean every company needs a lofty humanitarian mission, but it does mean leaders should continually articulate the “why” of the business in a way that resonates. A fintech startup CEO might emphasize how their product is democratizing finance access, or a manufacturing plant manager might talk about how the team’s work makes everyday life easier for people. Linking work to purpose is a leadership skill. “Good enough” leaders who focus only on the what (targets, outputs) and never on the why will have a harder time motivating younger employees who are conditioned to seek meaning in their work.

Furthermore, these generations expect leaders to walk the talk on values. Authenticity is paramount. They have grown up in an era of unprecedented information transparency (and also misinformation, making them skeptical), so they tend to quickly detect corporate hypocrisy or spin. If a company advertises commitments to diversity or sustainability, the younger employees expect to see concrete actions and will call out inconsistencies. A leader who says “people are our greatest asset” but then visibly disregards employee well-being or voices will not earn their trust. By contrast, leaders who show vulnerability, admit mistakes, and genuinely listen can earn deep loyalty. This is very much in line with the military idea of servant leadership, officers eat last, so to speak, taking care of their troops before themselves. Many younger workers admire leaders who exhibit humility and openness (hence the popularity of certain CEOs who are active on social media sharing personal reflections, etc.). It humanizes leadership, and this generation values that humanity over a distant, unapproachable persona.

Another shift is in communication style and frequency. Millennials and Gen Z grew up with constant connectivity and feedback loops (social media likes, etc.), so in the workplace they are accustomed to more continuous communication than an annual review or occasional memo. They don’t necessarily need praise every day (a stereotype), but they do appreciate knowing where they stand and how they’re doing much more frequently than older review cadences. Leaders should not interpret this as neediness; it’s an opportunity to guide and course-correct in real time, which is good for the organization too. A modern leader might implement quarterly development check-ins instead of yearly evaluations, or just make it a habit to give quick feedback after meetings and projects. It can be as simple as, “Hey, I noticed you handled that client question really well today, nice job,” or “Let’s debrief on what could be improved for next time.” These small interactions build a coaching relationship. Young employees want mentorship, recall that in Deloitte’s survey, many feel their managers are falling short on providing the guidance, inspiration, and mentorship they seek ￼. Filling that gap is a clear area where better leadership can yield benefits in morale and skill development.

Work-life balance and flexibility are another flashpoint. Younger generations are often blunt about wanting to enjoy life outside work and maintaining mental health. They are more likely to use their vacation days, more open about burnout, and more expectant that employers will accommodate flexible schedules or remote work. Leaders who came up in a culture of “first in, last out” may misinterpret this as a lack of work ethic. Generally, it’s not, it’s a recalibration of what a healthy relationship with work looks like. Effective leaders adapt by focusing on outcomes and trust (as discussed in the remote section) rather than time-in-seat. They recognize that an employee who leaves at 5 pm on the dot might be delivering excellent results and just setting healthy boundaries, which should be respected. Leaders should also proactively address burnout and encourage their teams to recharge, this generation will respect leaders who care about their well-being. On the flip side, a leader who responds to 11 pm emails and expects others to, or publicly lauds someone for “pulling an all-nighter,” will likely alienate younger staff who do not view constant overtime as a badge of honor the way previous generations sometimes did.

Importantly, as Millennials now ascend into middle and senior management themselves, they are changing the leadership ranks from within. Many of them are adopting different leadership practices, more collaborative, less formal, more tech-enabled, which companies should embrace. Forward-looking organizations pair the wisdom of experienced leaders with the fresh perspectives of younger ones. Reverse mentoring is one technique some firms use: pairing a junior employee with an executive to teach the exec about new technologies or social trends, which also empowers the junior person. This not only helps the older leader update their thinking, but signals to younger employees that their insights are valued in shaping the company.

In summary, generational change is raising the expectations for leadership to be more empathetic, purpose-driven, and development-oriented. Those qualities that might have once been considered “nice to have” in a leader are now often make-or-break in attracting and retaining young talent. A “good enough” leader who fails to evolve, who maybe still manages by fear or keeps distance from their team, will simply not get the full productivity or loyalty of Millennial and Gen Z employees. They might comply, but they won’t go the extra mile for someone they don’t respect. And they might leave as soon as the opportunity arises. Meanwhile, a leader who earns their trust by being authentic, invests in their growth, and aligns work with a purpose can tap into an incredible well of creativity and dedication. Companies need that energy, especially as these generations will dominate the workforce for decades to come. So adapting leadership styles to meet generational expectations is not indulgence, it’s a strategic necessity for performance. As one HR expert put it, “The best way to resolve intergenerational conflict is to build something greater, a common purpose”, which requires leaders who can unite diverse age groups under shared goals ￼. High-expectation leadership does exactly that, speaking to universal values that cross generations (like respect, growth, and mission), whereas “good enough” leadership often falls into the trap of “this is how we’ve always done it,” which no longer resonates.

### Steering Through Economic Uncertainty: The Call for Resilient Leadership

In the past few years, business leaders have been tested by an onslaught of economic turbulence, from the sudden pandemic recession to rapid interest rate hikes, inflation spikes, and ongoing volatility in supply chains and global trade. And the truth is, uncertainty isn’t going away; if anything, the cycles of boom-and-bust have become more compressed and less predictable. In this context, companies desperately need leaders who are calm, forward-thinking navigators of uncertainty. The high-expectation market means that stakeholders (employees, investors, customers) are watching closely how leaders react when conditions get tough or murky. Does the leader have a plan? Can they steady the ship and find opportunity amid uncertainty? Or do they flounder, deny problems, or make panicked moves? The difference can determine which companies survive or even thrive in uncertain times versus those that falter.

A “good enough” leader during stable times might have been one who could simply manage incrementally, adjusting budgets a bit up or down, following industry standard strategy, etc. But in times of crisis or rapid change, that kind of leader is often caught flat-footed. Consider the early pandemic: some retail CEOs immediately pivoted to build online sales channels when stores closed, while others effectively “waited it out” hoping normalcy would return, which turned out to be fatal for some businesses. Or think of inflation in 2022-2023: leaders who proactively managed pricing, supply contracts, and cost efficiencies protected margins, whereas those who were slow to respond saw profits plummet as costs outran their old pricing models. These examples underscore that uncertainty separates leaders from managers. Managers maintain; leaders transform under pressure.

What do high-performing leaders do differently in uncertain times? First, they embrace reality quickly and maintain transparency. Rather than being paralyzed or going into denial (e.g., insisting “this is just a temporary blip”), they assess the situation candidly and communicate with stakeholders about what is happening and what the company will do. Employees and investors can handle bad news; what they won’t forgive is being kept in the dark or misled. A strong leader might say, “Yes, demand is down 20% this quarter due to X. Here’s how we’re adjusting and why we’ll emerge stronger.” That builds trust. A weak leader might put out rosier-than-real projections to appease stakeholders, only to have to backtrack later, eroding credibility. High-expectation leadership means being authentic and realistic, while still instilling confidence that the team can adapt and prevail.

Second, great leaders use uncertainty as an opportunity to rally and refocus their teams on core priorities. When many things are in flux, identifying the few things that matter most is crucial. This harks to the military principle of commander’s intent again, providing clear focus. For example, during an economic downturn, a CEO might declare that the priority is customer retention and cash flow, and every team should align innovations or projects to those goals, while deprioritizing nice-to-haves. By simplifying objectives, leaders help employees channel their efforts productively rather than stress about every unknown. It also gives a sense of agency: “Even though we can’t control the economy, we can control our response in these key areas.” Such focus is far more effective than a leader who thrashes around launching too many initiatives or changing directions every week as new data comes in.

However, focus doesn’t mean rigidity. High-performance leaders remain flexible and ready to pivot as new information emerges, essentially applying an agile approach to strategy. They might deploy scenario planning: “If inflation stays high vs. if it drops, here’s what we’ll do in each case.” This preparedness allows quicker action when a scenario starts becoming reality. A McKinsey piece on change management noted that leaders must “rethink traditional change-management tools and master a more complex level of change” in radical reinvention efforts ￼. That implies being dynamically adaptable, not sticking to one playbook. It’s a delicate balance: provide a clear near-term plan, yet review it frequently and adjust course as needed. Leaders who communicate this approach openly (“here is Plan A, but we have Plan B/C if assumptions change”) gain respect for being proactive and not dogmatic.

Crucially, resilient leaders project composure and optimism even amid uncertainty. This doesn’t mean false optimism or bravado, but a steady demeanor that gives people confidence that together we can handle this. Employees in uncertain times look to leaders for emotional cues. If the leader seems defeated or in panic mode, guess what, the organization will mirror that and likely underperform or seize up. If the leader acknowledges challenges but emphasizes the team’s strengths and a belief in the mission, people are more likely to stay engaged and even find innovative solutions. There’s truth in the adage that “attitude reflects leadership.” One measure of leadership resilience was how companies handled layoffs or cost cuts in recent downturns: the most empathetic leaders communicated early, explained the rationale, provided support to those affected, and motivated the survivors to rebuild. Others took a cold, opaque approach, and are now dealing with lingering trust deficits internally. How a leader navigates necessary hardship can set the tone for the company’s culture long after the crisis passes.

Financial acumen is also tested under uncertainty. Boards and investors expect leaders to be disciplined and decisive in safeguarding the company’s financial health. This might include tough calls like postponing a capital project, divesting a non-core business, or raising prices, none of which are easy or popular. But delaying decisive actions can be worse. For example, companies that quickly right-sized their cost structures in a downturn often emerge with more fuel to invest in growth when the market turns, whereas those that delayed cuts sometimes end up in more severe retrenchment later (losing ground to competitors in the meantime). A high-expectation leader demonstrates the ability to make these decisions in a timely fashion, informed by data and guided by a long-term vision rather than just short-term panic.

One interesting note: a Russell Reynolds study on CEO turnover observed that in highly uncertain national contexts (like major political or economic upheaval), boards sometimes hold off on replacing CEOs ￼. The logic is, when external uncertainty is at peak, a sudden leadership change might add to instability. However, as soon as there’s a bit of stabilization, they often make a move to bring in new leadership with fresh skills for the next phase ￼. This indicates that boards are evaluating whether the current leader is the right one for the new context. Leaders should similarly self-evaluate: is my skill set what the company needs now? If not, how can I adapt or what help do I need? The most adaptive executives seek advice, bring in experts, or even step aside when the situation demands a different kind of leader. That level of honesty and lack of ego can be rare, but it’s a trait of the best leaders (some founders, for instance, hand the CEO role to someone more seasoned when their startup scales, showing maturity and prioritizing the company’s needs over personal pride).

In economically uncertain times, scenario-based mission command could be a useful hybrid concept: outline the mission (survive and thrive through X challenge) and empower different teams to execute contingency plans. For instance, a supply chain leader might have authority to switch suppliers or logistics modes quickly if tariffs or rates change, without needing multiple approvals, because the mission is clear (ensure supply at best cost). That agility can save money and time. A risk of “good enough” leadership is getting bogged in bureaucratic approval chains that are too slow for volatile conditions.

The current environment, with mixed economic signals, rapid tech disruption, and unpredictable geopolitical events, seems likely to persist. Thus, the premium on leaders who can guide their organizations through uncertainty will remain high. As PwC’s Tim Ryan noted, with investors raising the bar and so many forces at play, it’s perhaps the most challenging time ever to be a senior leader ￼. The flip side is that for leaders who can rise to the occasion, uncertain times are when they and their companies can truly distinguish themselves. Many iconic companies were forged during recessions or disruptive periods under visionary leadership that zigged while others zagged. High-expectation leadership means being ready to make those bold moves, to invest in a new technology during a downturn, to acquire a competitor when others are retrenching, or to reinvent the business model when old assumptions no longer hold. It requires courage and foresight. These are not qualities often attributed to “good enough” leaders, but they define those who excel in turbulence.

### Technological Disruption: Leading in the Era of Constant Innovation

Every industry today is a technology industry to some extent. From AI and machine learning to automation, cloud computing, and biotechnology, technological disruption is continuously reshaping markets and the very nature of work. For leaders, this presents a twofold challenge: adopting new technologies internally (digital transformation) and innovating new tech-enabled offerings externally (product or business model innovation). Both require a mindset that is curious, forward-looking, and not afraid to experiment. Here again, previously “adequate” leaders often stumble. If a leader is uncomfortable with technology or change, they may delay important tech investments or fail to see how a new technology could threaten or enhance their business. High-performing leaders, by contrast, stay informed about tech trends, encourage experimentation, and ensure their workforce builds the skills to leverage new tools. In a high-expectation market, stakeholders assume companies will harness technology to stay competitive, and they expect leaders to drive that effort.

One stark statistic frames the issue: A McKinsey report famously estimated that about 70% of large-scale digital transformation projects fail to meet their goals, often due to shortcomings in leadership and change management ￼. Many times, companies invest in the latest systems but don’t adapt processes or culture, leading to disappointment. This underscores that adopting technology is not just an IT issue, but a leadership issue. Leaders must articulate a vision of how technology will advance the company’s mission, and then align people, incentives, and processes to realize that vision. If they take a hands-off approach (“let the tech people handle it”), the effort might flounder due to lack of strategic direction or buy-in. Successful tech adoption almost always has an engaged leader at the helm who bridges the gap between technical possibilities and business value.

Consider the rise of artificial intelligence in recent years. Companies are racing to integrate AI into everything from customer service chatbots to data analytics and product features. A passive leader might think, “AI is hype, or it’s something for the IT team to figure out eventually.” An exceptional leader, however, will actively educate themselves on AI capabilities relevant to their industry, perhaps even taking a short course or appointing an AI advisory group. They will identify specific areas where AI could solve business problems or create differentiation, and then champion pilot projects to test it out. Crucially, they will address the people side: communicating how AI will augment rather than replace the workforce (in most cases), investing in retraining employees whose roles will evolve, and setting ethical guidelines for AI use. Leaders who ignore AI risk blindsiding, either their company falls behind competitors using AI, or they mishandle implementation and cause employee fear or customer backlash. We’re reaching a point where proficiency in digital and data literacy is almost a baseline expectation for leaders in many fields. Indeed, many boards now seek CEOs with tech fluency even for non-tech companies (e.g., a consumer goods CEO who understands e-commerce and data science). The “good enough” executives who rose through purely operational ranks without embracing technology will find it harder to be hired or retained at the top in coming years.

Another aspect of tech disruption is the acceleration of skill obsolescence. The half-life of skills is shrinking; new tools and programming languages emerge, automation takes over routine tasks, etc. Leaders must foster a culture of continuous learning within their organizations to stay ahead. A company cannot rely solely on hiring fresh talent for new skills, it should also reskill and upskill its existing workforce. This ties back to the adaptability principle: learning agility is key. Leaders should themselves be role models in learning new tech (even if just conceptually) and encourage their teams to take training, experiment with new digital tools, and cross-pollinate ideas. SHRM’s data shows that 75% of organizations struggled to fill roles due to technical and soft-skill gaps in applicants ￼, reflecting a broader workforce readiness challenge. Forward-thinking leaders address this by building “talent pipelines” via internal development programs, partnerships with educational institutions, or tapping nontraditional pools of talent. They see talent strategy and tech strategy as intertwined: you need the right skills in your people to exploit technology effectively ￼ ￼. So a CEO championing a big automation project should equally champion retraining programs to move frontline workers into new roles of overseeing automated systems, for example.

Leading through tech disruption also means taking calculated risks and tolerating failure to an extent. Not every new technology will pan out for a given business, but a leader who never tries will certainly fall behind. The military’s concept of “disciplined initiative” is relevant: allow teams to innovate (initiative) but within boundaries aligned to strategy (disciplined). A practical example is establishing innovation labs or skunkworks teams that have the freedom to prototype with emerging tech, without having to navigate the full corporate bureaucracy for every experiment. A strong leader will protect and fund these efforts and then quickly scale up the ones that show promise. A risk-averse leader might kill such experiments at the first setback or underfund them, essentially handcuffing the company’s innovative potential.

Leaders also need to be storytellers about technology, translating what a new tech means for the company’s future in a way that excites employees, investors, and customers. Take cloud computing in the last decade: Companies whose leaders painted a clear picture (“moving to cloud will make us more agile, reduce costs, and enable new services faster”) got stakeholder buy-in and executed transitions more smoothly than those whose leaders just said, “IT is changing our infrastructure.” Similarly now with AI or other trends, leaders must craft the narrative: how it fits the mission and values, how it benefits all stakeholders, and how the company will manage any risks. When Satya Nadella took over Microsoft, he famously declared a vision of “mobile-first, cloud-first” and then later the mission of “empowering every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more,” which underpinned their tech strategy ￼. That clarity helped align Microsoft’s huge workforce to embrace cloud and AI under his leadership, revitalizing the company. That’s the power of a tech-savvy leader with vision.

On the flip side, many companies that failed to adapt to a disruptive technology often had leaders in denial. Kodak’s leadership not fully embracing digital photography despite inventing it, or Blockbuster’s leadership dismissing streaming, are classic examples. The pattern is a leader who was successful in the old model and therefore couldn’t see the need to pivot, until it was too late. In today’s faster cycle, the window for such complacency is even smaller. Leaders must disrupt themselves before being disrupted by others. High-expectation stakeholders now often demand this; activist investors, for example, may pressure a company to adopt new tech or spin off legacy operations if they feel the CEO is dragging their feet on necessary innovation ￼.

Finally, with tech disruption comes new risks (cybersecurity, data privacy, etc.) and leaders have to be conversant in managing these as well. A leader doesn’t need to know the technical minutiae, but they should treat cyber risk with the seriousness of a core business risk, ensure proper governance, and be prepared to respond if (when) incidents occur. Similarly, ethical considerations around AI (bias, transparency) are leadership issues now, not just technical issues. Society and employees expect leaders to implement tech responsibly. So the bar is higher, it’s not just “did you implement new tech?” but “did you implement it in a way that is secure, ethical, and aligned with our values?” For instance, using AI to monitor employees can cross ethical lines and hurt trust if not handled carefully. A people-focused leader would think twice and involve employees in decisions about such technology use.

In conclusion, technological disruption is unforgiving to leaders who remain static. The high-expectation market assumes constant innovation as a given, and therefore only leaders who are innovation champions will meet the mark. This doesn’t mean every leader must be a coder or engineer, but they must be enablers of technology-driven progress. The military trains soldiers to use advanced tech on the battlefield but grounds them in strong leadership principles so the tech is used effectively; similarly, companies must blend tech adoption with leadership that guides and motivates people through the change. If “good enough” leaders of the past were those who kept the trains running on time, the leaders of the present and future are those who lay new tracks to destinations previously unreachable, and get the whole team on board for the journey.

## Forging the Path to High-Expectation Leadership

The evidence is overwhelming: organizations today cannot afford to have subpar leaders at the helm or in critical management roles. The demands of employees for inspirational, growth-oriented leadership; the insistence of investors and boards on visionary, accountable execution; and the complexity of operating in a fast-moving, tech-infused, uncertain world all point to the same conclusion, “good enough” is not good enough when it comes to leadership. Companies that continue to tolerate mediocre leadership behaviors will pay the price in underperformance, whether through talent bleeding away, missed strategic opportunities, or loss of market share to more dynamically led competitors. On the other hand, those that raise their leadership standards and deliberately cultivate high-expectation leaders will gain a formidable edge.

Developing and hiring such leaders should be a strategic priority at the highest level. CEOs and boards must ask themselves: do our current leaders exhibit the traits and competencies needed for this environment? Are we selecting future leaders based on yesterday’s criteria or today’s? Increasingly, progressive organizations are updating their leadership frameworks, incorporating qualities like adaptability, empathy, purpose-driven orientation, and tech-savvy into how they evaluate and promote leaders ￼ ￼. For example, instead of solely looking at financial results or tenure, they might assess how a leader navigated a crisis, how well they engage and inspire their team, or how open they are to learning new skills. Tools such as 360-degree feedback and leadership simulations can help identify whether a leader has the right stuff or just looks good on paper.

It’s also important to recognize that high-expectation leadership is not about perfection or never struggling. Even the best leaders have blind spots and will stumble at times. The difference is in how they respond, with humility, accountability, and determination to improve, rather than defensiveness or denial. One actionable takeaway is to foster a leadership culture of continuous improvement. Just as we expect the business to continuously improve, leaders at all levels should be expected to work on themselves, seek feedback, and evolve. This could be supported by executive coaching programs, leadership development workshops (perhaps drawing on some of those military leadership exercises that connect leaders with unfamiliar challenges), and creating safe spaces for leaders to discuss their challenges and learn from each other. When an organization’s top executives openly engage in learning (e.g., the CFO shares that they’re taking a course on AI in finance, the COO talks about being mentored on people management by a peer), it sends a powerful message down the line that development is a badge of ambition, not a sign of weakness.

For CEOs, private equity partners, and startup founders, our target audience, the call to action is clear. CEOs of established companies should champion a review of leadership talent and succession pipelines in light of the new expectations. Do you have the right generals for this battle? If not, you may need to make some changes, either by upskilling current leaders or bringing new leadership blood into the organization. And as the CEO, exemplify the behaviors you want to see: communicate the mission relentlessly, hold yourself accountable publicly, adapt quickly, and show genuine care for your people. As one BCG analysis noted, boards seek CEOs who “seek different points of view and invite constructive feedback…who acknowledge they may have been wrong” ￼, in other words, the age of the infallible, autocratic CEO is over; the effective CEO now is a chief listener and learner as much as a decider.

Private equity (PE) partners have a unique leverage point as they often influence or control CEO selection for their portfolio companies. The old PE playbook might have focused narrowly on finding a CEO with industry experience and operational efficiency. The new playbook should expand the criteria: ensure the CEOs (and CFOs, etc.) you install can handle the talent and culture aspect, can lead through uncertainty (not just cost-cut), and can drive necessary innovation. Many PE firms already recognize that a mediocre leader can quickly erode an investment’s value, and conversely, an exceptional leader can multiply it. Thus, thorough leadership assessment is becoming as important as financial due diligence. PE partners should also encourage their portfolio companies to invest in leadership development early, rather than treating people issues as secondary. For example, if a portfolio business is experiencing high turnover, a PE sponsor shouldn’t just chalk it up to labor market conditions; they should question whether leadership is the root cause and push for improvements there (maybe bringing in interim leadership or resources as needed, recalling that in 2024 a significant portion of forced CEO exits were driven by activist pressures on execution ￼, proactive PE firms won’t wait for activists; they’ll self-correct leadership issues to protect value).

Startup founders often start as the default leaders of their ventures, but as the company scales, the demands can rapidly exceed their initial skill set. We’ve seen many startups falter not for lack of product fit but due to leadership growing pains, internal chaos, cultural issues, inability to hire and keep talent, etc. Founders should be brutally honest about their own leadership gaps. The best ones either work to rapidly acquire new leadership skills (e.g., delegating, strategic planning, formal communication) or they make the courageous decision to bring in seasoned leaders to complement them (for instance, hiring a COO or even handing CEO reins to someone more experienced at a certain stage). High-expectation leadership in a startup context means not rationalizing “we’re growing so fast, some dysfunction is okay”, rather, instilling strong leadership values early to avoid scaling bad habits. Mission-driven startups can particularly benefit from military-like leadership clarity: having a strong mission culture can align even a small team through tumultuous pivots. Many startup employees are drawn by mission and a chance to be led by visionaries; if they instead encounter disorganization and ego-driven management, they’ll leave despite the cool idea.

Across all these contexts, actionable takeaways for implementing a high-expectation leadership model include:

- **Clearly define and communicate leadership expectations in your organization.** Update competency models to include the traits discussed (visionary thinking, empowerment, accountability, adaptability, emotional intelligence). Make it known that merely hitting numbers without exemplifying leadership values is not sufficient for advancement.
- **Invest in leadership development programs** that incorporate scenario-based learning, possibly borrowing from military training methods (e.g., crisis simulations, team-based problem-solving under pressure). Ensure these programs are not just for senior execs but also for emerging leaders at lower levels, to build a pipeline of capable leaders.
- **Promote a culture of feedback and coaching.** Encourage leaders to seek feedback from their teams (upward feedback) and to mentor others. Create mechanisms for employees to voice concerns about leadership anonymously, and address them. Talent retention correlates strongly with employees feeling they have a say and that their managers care ￼.
- **Align incentives to leadership behaviors.** For instance, incorporate employee engagement scores or team turnover rates into how managers are evaluated and rewarded, not just their financial metrics. This signals that “the how” of leadership is as important as “the what.”
- **Lead by example at the top.** The CEO and C-suite must model the desired behaviors: if adaptability is a value, show adaptability; if accountability is prized, own up to mistakes openly (imagine a CEO saying “I got that strategy wrong, here’s what we learned and how we’ll fix it”, it’s rare, but extremely powerful in building a culture of accountability).
- **Use outside perspectives.** Bringing in seasoned leaders from other fields (like retired military officers who transition to corporate leadership roles, which is increasingly common) can infuse new approaches. Consulting advisors or board members with a reputation for strong leadership can mentor your management team.
- **Don’t tolerate toxic or weak leadership at any level.** This means having the courage to remove or retrain managers who may deliver results but at the cost of culture or ethics (the long-term damage is not worth the short-term gain). As one LinkedIn commentary on leadership put it, failing to address poor managers means “your best people will find a leader who will” hold others accountable ￼. In a high-expectation market, the best people have options, and they will exercise them if leadership doesn’t improve.

In wrapping up, it’s useful to recall a classic principle from the U.S. Marine Corps: “Mission first, people always.” This captures the essence of high-performance leadership, an unyielding focus on achieving the mission, but never at the expense of the people executing it. It’s a balance of hard and soft skills, of driving results and nurturing the team, of confident command and humble service. The markets of today and tomorrow demand that leaders strike this balance. Those that do will not only avoid falling short, they will set new benchmarks for success.

In the final analysis, high-expectation markets actually present an opportunity: they force leadership excellence. Organizations that answer this call will find themselves with more engaged employees, more supportive investors, and more loyal customers, because strong leadership resonates through all aspects of a business. The bar may be higher now, but clearing that bar yields proportionately greater rewards. It’s time to move beyond “good enough” and commit to building the kind of leadership that is truly great. The future will belong to those who do.
