# Why “Good Enough” Leaders Are Falling Short

A few years ago, a “steady hand” could carry a leadership team through turbulence. Today, steadiness is table stakes. Expectations have climbed, the margin for error has shrunk, and the cost of slow or fuzzy leadership is showing up faster than most organizations are used to seeing.

Boards are less patient. Employees are less forgiving. Customers <!--more-->have more options. And transformation is no longer a once-a-decade event. It is the operating environment.

That is the heart of the high-expectation market. The world did not just get more competitive. It got more transparent. Performance gaps are visible sooner. Culture gaps are felt sooner. Leadership gaps are exposed immediately.

CEO turnover data and board-level scrutiny are strong signals of this shift. Spencer Stuart’s CEO transitions research tracks thousands of leadership changes across the S&P 1500, offering a real-time view of how quickly “fit” can be questioned when results or confidence wobble. A Reuters report, citing Russell Reynolds Associates, highlighted record global CEO departures in 2024 and pointed to investor pressure and activism as major forces behind accelerated exits.

At the same time, leaders are being asked to do something deceptively hard: deliver outcomes while rebuilding clarity, trust, and discipline inside systems that feel overloaded.

That combination is exactly why “good enough” leaders are falling short.

Not because they are bad people. Not because they lack intelligence. Often, they have strong resumes and a history of results. They fall short because the market has changed the definition of leadership competence.

In a high-expectation market, the role is no longer to “run the function.” The role is to create direction, build energy, make hard calls early, and establish operating discipline that holds under pressure.

This article is built for owners, boards, CEOs, CHROs, and executive search partners who are tired of hiring impressive storytellers and want leaders who can execute with clarity and intention.

We will cover:  
- What the high-expectation market actually is, and why it changes leadership requirements  
- The hidden ways “good enough” leaders fail  
- A practical model for clarity, reset, and leadership discipline  
- How to hire for intention (not just experience) using executive search rigor  
- How to prevent a new hire from sliding back into reaction mode in the first 90 days

## The high-expectation market is not a vibe. It is a new operating math.

You can feel it in the way teams talk. Fewer people are impressed by titles. More people want proof. And leaders are being judged through three unforgiving lenses:

1. **Speed of sense-making**  
   How fast can you reduce noise into meaning? Not a motivational speech. Meaning. What matters, what does not, and what happens next.

2. **Quality of decisions under ambiguity**  
   Not every choice has perfect data. High-expectation environments punish leaders who stall, spin, or wait for certainty that never arrives.

3. **Consistency of operating discipline**  
   Can you build a cadence that holds, even when the quarter gets ugly? Or does the team default to chaos, heroics, and late-night fire drills?

These expectations are rising while the talent market remains strained. Korn Ferry’s “talent crunch” research has argued for years that supply and demand gaps are real and growing, which makes the cost of leadership mistakes even higher because replacement is harder than it looks.

And the skills employers say they need are not just technical. The World Economic Forum’s *Future of Jobs 2025* highlights analytical thinking, resilience, flexibility, and leadership/social influence among the core capabilities organizations are prioritizing.

Put those together and you get a leadership paradox:  
- You need leaders who can run today’s business.  
- You also need leaders who can redesign tomorrow’s business.  
- You need them to do both while managing talent strain, shifting skills, and constant volatility.  

That is not a “nice-to-have” profile. That is a different species of leader.

## Why “good enough” leaders are falling short

“Good enough” leaders tend to share a few patterns. You might recognize them because they can look competent for a while, especially in interviews.

### 1. They confuse motion with progress

They stay busy. They attend every meeting. They respond quickly. They “clear their inbox.”

But their teams stay unclear. Priorities drift. Projects multiply. Nobody can tell you what will matter in 90 days.

The trap is subtle: activity feels responsible, but it can hide avoidance. Clear prioritization forces trade-offs. Trade-offs create discomfort. Reaction feels safer.

### 2. They lead from personal urgency instead of shared intention

When everything feels important, leaders start using instinct as the operating system. That can work for short bursts, but over time it turns the organization into a mirror of the leader’s anxiety.

Harvard Business Review recently published a piece directly addressing this dynamic, framing the problem as leaders becoming too reactive in an era where everything feels urgent.

A reactive leader does not necessarily make “wrong” decisions. The deeper issue is that the organization cannot predict the decision logic. People stop planning and start waiting.

### 3. They default to charisma instead of cadence

Charisma can inspire. It cannot replace a system.

In high-expectation markets, teams do not just need inspiration. They need:  
- clear metrics  
- clear ownership  
- clear escalation paths  
- a rhythm for decisions  
- feedback loops that correct drift early  

Without cadence, execution becomes personality-driven. That is unstable, especially during growth or turnaround.

### 4. They over-index on expertise and under-index on leadership behaviors

Many leaders were promoted because they were great at their craft. Sales. Engineering. Finance. Operations.

But managing a function is not the same as leading people through complexity. Gallup’s research has repeatedly emphasized how central managers are to engagement outcomes. Their *State of the Global Workplace* reporting has noted that managers account for a large share of variance in team engagement.

In plain language, leadership quality shows up in human energy, and human energy shows up in results.

### 5. They avoid the “hard conversations” until they become “hard situations”

A “good enough” leader often wants to be liked. They postpone tough feedback. They tolerate fuzzy accountability. They let political behavior slide because confronting it feels risky.

High-expectation environments punish that delay. Small culture cracks become structural damage.

### 6. They hire in their own image

Reactive leaders hire for relief. They want someone who “can take things off my plate.”

Intentional leaders hire for capacity. They want someone who makes the whole system stronger.

That is a crucial executive search distinction: are we hiring to reduce pain today, or to raise performance tomorrow?

## The hidden cost of leadership drift: it shows up where you least want it

Leadership drift is the gradual slide from intention to reaction. It rarely happens in one dramatic collapse. It happens in tiny, repeated compromises:  
- we add one more priority without removing one  
- we delay a decision “until next week”  
- we tolerate a weak leader because replacing them feels hard  
- we accept a mediocre plan because at least it is a plan  
- we keep meetings that no longer produce outcomes  

Over time, drift creates three organizational symptoms:

### Symptom 1: Priority fog

People cannot tell you the top three goals without checking a slide deck.

### Symptom 2: Escalation addiction

Everything becomes a leadership decision because the system does not empower decision-making at the right levels.

### Symptom 3: Execution fatigue

Teams work hard but feel behind. They stop believing effort will translate into progress.

This is why boards are more impatient now. “We are working on it” is no longer convincing. Investors and directors see too many examples of rapid CEO change and faster resets, so tolerance for slow, fuzzy leadership is lower.

## A practical model: Clarity, Reset, Leadership Discipline

If you want to hire and develop leaders who thrive in a high-expectation market, you need a simple operating model that translates into observable behavior.

Here is one that works across industries because it targets the real failure points: **Clarity, Reset, Discipline**.

### 1. Clarity: reducing complexity into direction

Clarity is not a slogan. It is a series of decisions that remove ambiguity.

A leader with clarity can answer, without spinning:  
- What are we solving?  
- Why now?  
- What does “winning” look like in measurable terms?  
- What are we not doing?  
- Who owns what?  
- How will we review progress, and how often?  

McKinsey’s work on organizational health emphasizes that long-term performance is heavily influenced by how leaders make decisions, allocate resources, and run the place day-to-day. That is clarity in action, not strategy theater.

**What clarity looks like in a high-expectation market**  
- fewer priorities, stated in plain language  
- clear trade-offs and resource moves that match the talk  
- simple scorecards teams can recite  
- decisions documented as “here is what we decided and why”  

**What clarity is not**  
- a 40-slide strategy deck  
- a rebrand of last year’s priorities  
- “alignment meetings” that end with no decisions  

### 2. Reset: breaking reaction loops and rebuilding trust

Reset is the leader’s ability to interrupt drift. It includes emotional control, organizational courage, and the willingness to confront reality early.

Deloitte’s *Global Human Capital Trends* has been pushing the conversation toward “human performance” and the gap between knowing what needs to change and actually doing it. That gap is often a leadership reset problem, not a knowledge problem.

**Reset has three layers**  
- **Personal reset:** the leader regains composure and stops transmitting urgency as a culture.  
- **Team reset:** roles, expectations, and decision rights get clarified.  
- **System reset:** the operating cadence is rebuilt so progress is measurable.  

A leader who cannot reset will eventually create a culture of permanent urgency. People burn out, disengage, or quietly leave in place.

### 3. Leadership discipline: the operating cadence that holds under pressure

Discipline is where many impressive leaders fail.

They know what to do, but they cannot build a system that makes it repeatable.

Leadership discipline includes:  
- weekly execution reviews that drive decisions, not updates  
- monthly business reviews that force trade-offs  
- talent reviews that confront performance reality  
- structured one-on-ones that develop people, not just track tasks  
- a feedback culture that is direct and humane  

McKinsey’s research on psychological safety and leadership behaviors reinforces the idea that leaders must demonstrate consistent behaviors to create the climate where teams can perform. Discipline is how you make those behaviors consistent.

## Reaction vs. intention: the hiring question nobody asks directly

Most executive search processes still overweight pedigree:  
- brand-name companies  
- big titles  
- big scope  
- impressive storytelling  

Those are not useless signals, but they are incomplete. In a high-expectation market, the key question is simpler:

**When pressure rises, does this leader become more intentional, or more reactive?**

That is the separation line.

**Reactive leadership patterns (watch for these in interviews)**  
- Blames market conditions without naming controllable levers  
- Describes work as nonstop firefighting, almost with pride  
- Talks in broad narratives but struggles to specify what they stopped doing  
- Uses “we” to describe wins and “they” to describe problems  
- Avoids naming the hardest personnel decision they made and why  
- Cannot articulate an operating cadence they built and maintained  

**Intentional leadership patterns (listen for these)**  
- Names trade-offs clearly, including what they killed  
- Can explain decision logic in simple language  
- Uses facts and rhythm, not drama  
- Can describe how they built leaders under them  
- Demonstrates calm urgency, not anxious urgency  
- Describes how they reset a drifting culture  

If you are a board, CEO, or CHRO, this is the moment to stop hiring for comfort and start hiring for intention.

## Executive search in a high-expectation market: a stronger method

Here is a practical executive search approach built for this market. It is not theoretical. It is designed to reduce false positives.

### Step 1: Redefine the role as an outcome, not a scope

Most role profiles are written as responsibilities. High-expectation roles must be written as outcomes.

Instead of:  
- “Lead operations across five sites.”

Use:  
- “Increase on-time delivery from X to Y while reducing expedited freight by Z, and rebuild site leader accountability with a weekly operating cadence.”

This matters because “good enough” leaders can manage scope. Intentional leaders drive outcomes.

### Step 2: Use a “clarity test” in the first interview

Ask the candidate to explain, in five minutes:  
- what the business was trying to achieve  
- what was in the way  
- what they chose as the top three priorities  
- what they stopped doing  
- how they measured progress weekly  

If they cannot make it simple, they probably cannot make it simple at work.

### Step 3: Replace generic competency questions with decision-forcing questions

Generic: “Tell me about a time you led change.”

Decision-forcing:  
- “Tell me about a decision you made with incomplete information that materially changed trajectory. What data did you wish you had? What did you do instead?”  
- “What did you kill? Not delay. Kill. Why?”  
- “Describe the operating rhythm you installed. What happened in week 2 when people resisted it?”  
- “What did you tolerate for too long? What did it cost?”  
- “Who did you upgrade on your leadership team, and what did you learn from the miss that led to the replacement?”  

These questions expose intention, not just experience.

### Step 4: Build reference calls around patterns, not praise

Most reference calls are too polite. You need pattern confirmation.

Ask references:  
- “When pressure hit, did they get calmer or more intense?”  
- “How did they make decisions when the room disagreed?”  
- “Did they build a cadence that survived after they left?”  
- “What kind of talent did they attract?”  
- “What is the biggest leadership shadow they cast?”  

You are trying to identify drift risk.

### Step 5: Validate discipline with artifacts

Ask for real examples (sanitized):  
- a scorecard  
- a meeting cadence outline  
- a one-page strategy  
- a sample operating review agenda  
- an org design rationale they authored  

Leaders who rely on charisma often cannot produce artifacts. Leaders who run systems usually can.

## The “Leadership Discipline Index”: a simple evaluation rubric

To make this operational, score candidates across three categories. Use a 1 to 5 scale.

### A) Clarity
- Can they define winning in measurable terms?  
- Do they simplify complexity without oversimplifying reality?  
- Do they make trade-offs cleanly?  

### B) Reset
- Can they name how they interrupted drift?  
- Do they demonstrate calm under pressure?  
- Can they confront performance issues without creating fear?  

### C) Discipline
- Have they built repeatable operating cadences?  
- Can they hold leaders accountable consistently?  
- Do they run talent systems, not just performance conversations?  

A candidate does not need a perfect score, but they must be strong in the dimension the business is currently missing.

## Why executive search misses still happen, even with “good” processes

Even strong teams make leadership mistakes because of predictable biases:

### Bias 1: “They have done it before, so they can do it here”

Context matters. A leader can thrive in a stable environment and struggle in a volatile one.

The right question:  
- “What conditions made them effective, and do we have those conditions?”

### Bias 2: “They are confident, so they are capable”

Confidence helps in interviews. It can also mask weak discipline.

### Bias 3: “They talk strategy, so they can execute”

Some leaders are great narrators. High-expectation markets require builders.

Spencer Stuart’s board and CEO research ecosystem reflects a broader reality: governance expectations evolve, and the bar for demonstrated leadership capability is rising.

## The first 90 days: how to prevent a high-priced hire from reverting to reaction

Even an intentional leader can get swallowed by a reactive culture. The first 90 days must be designed to lock in clarity and discipline early.

Here is a practical approach.

### Days 1 to 15: Diagnose without absorbing chaos
- Identify the “noise channels” that create urgency  
- Map decision rights (who decides what)  
- Confirm the real constraints: talent, cash, capacity, customer issues  
- Hold listening sessions, but do not promise fixes yet  

**Deliverable:** a one-page “current reality” summary.

### Days 16 to 30: Establish clarity and kill something
- Name the top three priorities for the next 90 days  
- Kill or pause at least one major initiative  
- Define “winning” with simple metrics  
- Agree on meeting cadence changes with the CEO and peers  

**Deliverable:** a 90-day execution plan with a weekly scorecard.

### Days 31 to 60: Install discipline and confront talent reality
- Run weekly execution reviews that drive decisions  
- Clarify role expectations for direct reports  
- Make at least one meaningful talent move if needed  
- Create a visible feedback loop: “we said we would do X, here is progress”  

**Deliverable:** operating cadence documentation and updated role scorecards.

### Days 61 to 90: Build momentum and reduce escalation
- Push decision-making down with guardrails  
- Build leadership bench depth  
- Improve cross-functional trust by making trade-offs transparent  
- Start planning the next 2 quarters with fewer priorities  

**Deliverable:** a forward plan and a stronger leadership team operating rhythm.

If you do this well, the leader becomes a stabilizer and an accelerator, not a new participant in the chaos.

## What “leadership discipline” looks like in real life

Let’s make it tangible.

A disciplined leader:  
- says no more than yes  
- runs fewer meetings, but makes them decision-focused  
- documents decisions and revisits them when conditions change  
- treats talent as the main lever, not an HR process  
- creates a culture where people know what matters this week  
- is direct, calm, and consistent  

A reactive leader:  
- adds priorities when anxious  
- fills calendars to feel in control  
- makes decisions in hallways, then “socializes” after  
- tolerates poor performance to avoid disruption  
- treats communication as a substitute for clarity  
- changes direction often enough that people stop committing  

When you hire for discipline, you are not hiring for rigidity. You are hiring for rhythm.

And rhythm is what makes performance sustainable.

## The market is demanding a new standard of leader

The labor market may tighten or loosen. Technology will keep shifting. Investor expectations will keep evolving. Workforce expectations will keep rising. The direction is clear: leadership roles are getting harder.

Conference Board research on 2025 priorities emphasizes that leaders are preparing for ongoing economic and geopolitical turbulence and are focused on thriving, not merely surviving. Russell Reynolds’ Global Leadership Monitor highlights persistent concern about key talent availability and preparedness to face uncertainty.

In other words, the pressure is not temporary.

So “good enough” leadership, the kind that relies on experience, presence, and hustle, will keep getting exposed.

The leaders who win next will be the ones who:  
- create clarity quickly  
- reset drift early  
- build discipline that holds under stress  
- move from reaction to intention as a habit, not a headline  

That is what high-expectation markets are paying for now.

---

## Practical takeaway: the hiring upgrade checklist

If you want a simple, usable checklist to apply immediately, use this.

### Before you hire
- Are outcomes defined clearly, or is the role described as “scope”?  
- Do you know what must be stopped, not just started?  
- Is the culture currently reactive? If yes, how will you protect the new leader from being absorbed by it?  

### During interviews
- Can the candidate explain trade-offs and what they killed?  
- Can they describe a cadence they built, with specifics?  
- Can they show how they reset a drifting team?  
- Do they communicate with calm clarity, even under pushback?  

### After you hire
- Do they have a 90-day plan that includes killing something?  
- Have they installed weekly execution discipline by day 30?  
- Are decisions getting clearer and faster by day 60?  
- Is escalation decreasing by day 90?  

If those answers are yes, you likely hired an intentional leader.

If those answers are vague, you probably hired a talented reactor.
