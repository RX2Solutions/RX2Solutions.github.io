# Hiring for What Resonates: Influence vs. Experience

**Experience is history. Influence is destiny.**

For too long, organizations have equated leadership with résumés titles held, years served, boxes checked. But true transformation doesn’t come from a career timeline. It comes from leaders who carry influence; <!--more-->the kind that rallies people, dissolves resistance, and makes the future feel inevitable.

In an era where change is constant, **influence has become the most valuable leadership currency.**

## Why Influence Matters More Than Experience

Experience tells you where someone has been. Influence tells you where they can take you.

Research shows the distinction is real:

- In a **field experiment with 1,273 participants**, leaders who *motivated* their teams outperformed those who simply *coordinated tasks*, proving emotional influence drives higher outputs than managerial experience alone.
- Prosci’s global study found **88% of organizations with strong change leadership hit their goals**, versus just **13%** with poor leadership.
- A meta-analysis of **Leader-Member Exchange (LMX)** across 23 countries revealed that leaders with high trust and rapport saw stronger job satisfaction, higher retention, and greater team citizenship.

The lesson is simple: titles can open doors, but influence can move walls.

## Leadership Traits That Drive Change

Influence shows up not in the résumé, but in the room. The traits that separate influential leaders from merely experienced ones include:

- **Vision with Gravity** – They paint a picture of the future that people lean toward instinctively.
- **Emotional Command** – They redirect conflict into progress, energy into momentum.
- **Credibility Without Title** – People follow them because of trust, not hierarchy.
- **Momentum Builders** – They create inevitability around change, making resistance look small.

Influence is the multiplier effect. It turns leadership from a task into a movement.

## Experience vs. Title: The Hiring Trap

A Director without influence is just a manager with paperwork.

A Coordinator with influence can quietly reshape strategy.

- **Title is authority on paper. Influence is authority in motion.**
- Titles demand compliance. Influence earns commitment.
- Titles expire. Influence compounds.

When evaluating candidates, the question isn’t *“What have they done?”* but *“Who did they move?”*

## A New Lens for Hiring

Hiring for influence requires a new playbook. Instead of stacking résumés, we must evaluate presence, persuasion, and trust.

### Signals of Influence

| Signal | What to Ask / Observe | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stories of persuasion without authority** | “Tell me about a time you got buy-in without formal power.” | Influence is clearest when titles don’t back it up. |
| **Metrics of cultural impact** | Retention gains, engagement shifts, adoption rates. | Experience lists tasks; influence shows outcomes. |
| **Peer and team feedback** | 360° reviews, subordinate insights. | Influence is granted by people, not self-claimed. |
| **Presence in the room** | Do others lean in when they speak? Do they build trust quickly? | Influence is felt, not just spoken. |

## Data-Driven Ways to Measure Influence

Organizations that want rigor can bake influence into their metrics:

- **Employee Engagement Scores** – Does this leader inspire commitment?
- **Retention Rates** – Do high performers stay longer under them?
- **Change Adoption Rates** – How quickly do teams embrace new systems under their lead?
- **Innovation Indicators** – Do teams initiate new ideas under their influence?
- **Cultural Alignment** – Do they embody and spread company values in action?

## The Bigger Picture

Hiring for influence isn’t about ignoring experience. It’s about refusing to mistake history for destiny. The future belongs to those who can inspire, mobilize, and multiply human energy.

Imagine an organization where every leader, formal or emergent moves people not because they must, but because they want to. Where influence flows at every level, from senior executives to rising stars.

That’s not just better hiring. That’s how cultures evolve.

That’s how legacies are built.

## Power Lines to Highlight

- “Experience is history. Influence is destiny.”
- “A title can open doors. Influence can move walls.”
- “Don’t just ask, ‘What have they done?’ Ask, ‘Who have they moved?’”
- “Influence is the invisible force that shapes the future.”
