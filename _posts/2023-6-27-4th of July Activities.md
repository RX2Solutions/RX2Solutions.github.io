- **_Conshohocken, Sutcliffe Park_** <br>
Monday, July 3, 2023 | 9:30 p.m. <br>
The Borough of Conshohocken will host the Fireworks Display on Monday, July 3, 2023. Fireworks begin at dusk approximately around 9:30 p.m. The fireworks display will be larger so that fireworks may be visible from as many vantage points as possible throughout the Borough. Due to the larger size of fireworks, a wider safety perimeter surrounding the discharge zone is required. As such, Sutcliffe Park and surrounding areas will be closed to the public during the event. Tests of the larger Fireworks display were completed to ensure that the majority of the Borough could still view and enjoy the fireworks from outside Sutcliffe Park.<br>
