---

## Macroeconomic Overview: Navigating a Complex Landscape

As we step deeper into Q3 2025, the U.S. economy is projecting stability‚Äînot without its headwinds. The GDP is anticipated to grow at an annualized rate of **2.1%** for the latter half of the year, <!--more--> a modest yet steady climb that reflects a recalibrated post-pandemic economy.

Meanwhile, core inflation appears to be cooling, with the **Federal Reserve maintaining interest rates** as it closely monitors both inflationary pressure and consumer confidence.

> Geopolitical dynamics, global supply chain volatility, and emerging technology sectors continue to impact capital investment and operational planning across industries.

## Labor Market Dynamics: Stability with a Side of Unease

National unemployment remains low at **4.2%**, yet **recent graduates and entry-level professionals** are encountering growing friction‚Äîhighlighted by a youth unemployment rate now above **5.8%**, the highest since 2021.

This divide signals a broader challenge: **demand for specific, market-ready skillsets is outpacing supply**.

> Hiring trends are shifting more decisively toward **skill-first strategies**, with employers prioritizing practical experience and technical fluency‚Äîespecially in sectors like **tech, healthcare, and sustainability**.
