Jeff Carroll brings over 20 years of client management and business development experience in Technology Staffing and Solutions. He employs a consultative approach with his clients, fostering long-term relationships which aligns well with the RX2 Solutions culture and Respectfully Professional Process.
His flexible approach allows ease of use for all his clients and he’s excited to bring his knowledge and experience to the RX2 family. Jeff grew up in the Philly suburbs and graduated from Ursinus College with a bachelor’s degree in marketing.

Outside of work, Jeff enjoys spending time with his wife and 2 daughters playing golf, working out, and enjoying craft beer, scotch, and bourbon. And, of course, all things Philly sports.

“I am extremely excited to join the RX2 Family.  I look forward to working with the team to help them succeed and grow the client base and business.  They have a great culture, team, and client base.  As a team we can take RX2 to the next level.”  When asked why he chose RX2, “I have known Rob for about a decade and he has always been one of the best in the business.  And I have competed against Ross for over a decade as well.  It only made sense to combine forces and take RX2 to the next level.”

**About RX2 Solutions:**
