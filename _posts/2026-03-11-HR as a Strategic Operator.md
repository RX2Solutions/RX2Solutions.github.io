## **HR as an Operating Partner, Not a Support Function**

Private equity firms have always understood that deals are won with strong financials and sound operating plans. What has changed is the growing realization that those plans live or die with people.

Today, human capital is no longer a secondary concern. It is central to value creation. Nearly two-thirds of private equity investors now rank talent as their top issue outside of revenue growth. Yet fewer than half of portfolio company executives share that same urgency. That disconnect<!--more--> matters. When leadership teams underestimate the role of talent, execution suffers and value erodes.

This gap exists largely because HR has historically been viewed as a back-office support function. Forward-looking firms are moving away from that model. They are reframing HR as a true operating partner, embedded in value creation rather than positioned as an administrative cost center. The reason is simple. Real value is not created in spreadsheets. It is created by people executing a strategy well.

Despite this shift, human capital remains one of the most underutilized levers in private equity. Only about one-third of firms have a structured talent strategy that spans the full investment lifecycle. The competitive edge will belong to firms willing to change that paradigm.

## **From Support Function to Strategic Partner**

For years, HR inside portfolio companies focused on hiring, benefits, and compliance. All necessary functions, but rarely viewed as drivers of growth. That mindset is changing quickly.

Leading private equity firms are elevating HR leaders into executive-level roles with real influence. At firms like Apollo and Blackstone, the CHRO sits at the executive table and participates in investment and strategy discussions. That visibility ensures talent decisions are aligned with value creation goals, not addressed after the fact.

Many firms have also introduced dedicated Human Capital Operating Partners. These are seasoned leaders who work alongside deal teams and portfolio CEOs from day one. Their role is not transactional. It is strategic. They treat leadership, culture, and organizational design as core value drivers.

Blue Wolf Capital is one clear example, with a formal Operating Partner for Human Capital embedded in its operating model. This structure reflects a broader industry truth. Human capital is one of the most important elements of success in a private equity investment, as critical as finance or strategy, yet historically overlooked. That is beginning to change, and the results are showing up across the ownership lifecycle.

## **Human Capital as a Value Creation Lever**

Talent excellence has become a measurable lever for value creation. Leadership development, engagement, and organizational alignment now directly influence operational performance and enterprise value.

The data is consistent. Firms that invest in people outperform those that do not. Deloitte has noted that while the most successful PE firms understand value is created by people, only about 35 percent have formal talent strategies in place. That gap represents significant upside.

PwC echoes this point, highlighting human capital as a largely untapped opportunity to drive stronger financial outcomes while improving job quality. When employees are aligned, engaged, and developed, execution improves. Productivity rises. EBITDA follows.

There is also a risk side to the equation. CEO turnover in PE-backed companies remains high, with more than half replaced within two years of investment. In a market where holding periods are stretching five to seven years or longer, leadership continuity and cultural stability matter more than ever. Firms that approach HR as a value driver rather than a support function are better positioned to manage that risk.

## **Integrating HR Across the Investment Lifecycle**

To maximize enterprise value, HR must be involved at every stage of the investment lifecycle. The operating partner model reflects this reality.

**Due Diligence and Deal Thesis**

Progressive firms now assess leadership and culture during diligence, not after close. Confidential referencing, leadership assessments, and cultural alignment reviews are increasingly standard. Identifying talent risks early allows firms to plan leadership upgrades or, in some cases, reconsider a deal entirely.

Investcorp’s acquisition of The Wrench Group is a strong example. The deal thesis placed real weight on management quality and culture. By prioritizing those elements from the start, Investcorp significantly scaled the business and exited at roughly three times its original investment.

**Post-Acquisition and Organization Design**

The first 100 days set the tone. HR operating partners play a central role in leadership assessment, org design, and early integration. Many firms evaluate the CEO and C-suite immediately post-close and prepare succession options in advance.

Team effectiveness initiatives are also launched early. Roughly three-quarters of PE firms now focus on organizational effectiveness within the first year of ownership. Aligning roles, incentives, and accountability structures with the value creation plan creates momentum from day one.

**Growth and Operational Execution**

Throughout the hold period, HR partners help scale the business through leadership development, workforce planning, and cultural alignment. Firms like Arsenal Capital Partners invest heavily in leadership forums, development plans, and biannual reviews to ensure their teams are prepared for growth.

Engagement and retention are equally important. In tight labor markets, even the best strategy fails without the right people to execute it. Firms such as KKR have formal Human Capital Excellence practices dedicated to recruiting, retention, and engagement. These efforts directly support operational improvements that drive sustainable EBITDA growth.

**Exit Readiness and Succession**

As exit approaches, human capital readiness becomes part of the equity story. Buyers place a premium on strong leadership benches, clear succession plans, and cultural stability.

Regular talent reviews are now common across mid-cap and large-cap funds. The objective is simple. Avoid leadership gaps that introduce risk at the most critical moment. Well-planned transitions protect value and build buyer confidence.

## **Leadership, Culture, and Incentives as Value Drivers**

HR operating partners deploy a practical toolkit to support value creation.

Leadership development is no longer optional. Firms invest in coaching, peer forums, and structured development plans to strengthen execution capability.

Culture is treated as a performance lever, not a soft concept. Engagement surveys, employee feedback loops, and shared ownership models help reinforce accountability and innovation.

Incentives are aligned to long-term outcomes. Equity participation, profit sharing, and retention tools extend beyond the CEO to key operators. This ownership mindset keeps teams focused on enterprise value, not short-term wins.

Performance management is disciplined and transparent. Clear KPIs, regular reviews, and timely leadership decisions prevent drift and protect momentum. HR partners support these processes, ensuring follow-through and accountability.

## **People at the Center of Portfolio Value**

The conclusion is straightforward. A business-forward HR function is now essential in private equity.

Talent, leadership, and culture are not abstract ideas. They are tangible drivers of performance, risk management, and growth. Firms that embed human capital expertise alongside financial and operational strategy consistently outperform.

The best private equity firms treat HR as a true operating partner. They engage early, stay involved, and align people strategy with the investment thesis at every stage. That approach delivers scalability, resilience, and stronger exits.

In modern private equity, investing in human capital is not ideological. It is practical. It is disciplined. And it is simply good business.
