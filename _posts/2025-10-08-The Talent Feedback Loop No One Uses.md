# How One Simple Feedback Loop Can Elevate Your Talent Strategy

Every organization claims to value feedback. Yet, when it comes to hiring, most companies ignore two of the most powerful data sources at their fingertips: exit interviews and candidate feedback. <!--more-->

It‚Äôs a costly oversight. The average cost of a bad hire is estimated at **30% of that employee‚Äôs annual salary** (U.S. Department of Labor). Add in lost productivity, impact on morale, and the ripple effect of turnover, and the stakes become clear.

The question isn‚Äôt whether feedback exists; it‚Äôs whether leaders are using it to refine how they attract, assess, and retain talent.

## Exit Interviews: Lessons in Plain Sight

Exit interviews often uncover patterns that leadership quietly suspects but struggles to quantify:

- Lack of growth opportunities
- Misalignment between role expectations and reality
- Cultural friction with managers or teams

Consider this: **91% of employees say they left their last job due to lack of career development** (Gallup). If that theme surfaces consistently in exit interviews, it‚Äôs not a one-off‚Äîit‚Äôs a signal that talent pathways need to be strengthened.

The tragedy? Too many organizations document these conversations, file them away, and never connect the dots.

## Candidate Feedback: The Forgotten Half of Hiring

Candidates, whether hired or not, are an equally valuable source of intelligence. Their perspective reveals whether your process supports your brand or undermines it.

Data backs this up:

- **60% of job seekers** report a poor candidate experience, and **72% share it online** (CareerArc).
- **49% decline offers** after a negative hiring experience, even if the role and salary fit (LinkedIn).

Feedback often points to the basics: interview scheduling delays, unclear communication, or misaligned expectations across interviewers. Small process gaps can lead to big losses, especially in competitive markets where skilled professionals have options.

## The Feedback Loop Most Companies Miss

When you connect exit and candidate feedback, a bigger picture emerges:

- Departing employees highlight what‚Äôs not working inside.
- Candidates spotlight how those same cracks show up in the hiring process.

That loop, if captured and acted upon, becomes a strategic roadmap. Yet most companies never close it.

## Why Internal HR Struggles to Keep Pace

Internal HR teams are stretched thin. Between compliance, employee relations, payroll, and benefits, the bandwidth for deep hiring refinement is limited.

The result? Exit interviews are treated as a formality. Candidate surveys are rare. And valuable insights slip through the cracks, leaving the same issues to resurface year after year.

## Where Outsourced HR Shifts the Equation

This is where outsourcing becomes a game changer. A trusted HR partner can:

- **Systematize feedback collection** ‚Äì turning scattered data into structured insight.
- **Benchmark against the market** ‚Äì comparing candidate experiences and turnover drivers to industry norms.
- **Streamline hiring processes** ‚Äì ensuring timely communication, consistent interviewing, and sharper role clarity.
- **Provide objectivity** ‚Äì surfacing uncomfortable truths leadership may overlook.

Outsourced HR isn‚Äôt about replacing internal teams, it‚Äôs about extending their reach, freeing them to focus on culture and engagement while specialists refine the hiring engine.

## A Competitive Advantage Waiting to Be Claimed

The evidence is clear:

- Companies with strong candidate experiences improve quality of hire by **70%** (Glassdoor).
- Organizations that act on exit feedback reduce voluntary turnover by **up to 30%** in the following year (SHRM).

This isn‚Äôt theory. It‚Äôs measurable. And it‚Äôs a competitive advantage hiding in plain sight.

---

‚úÖ **Final Takeaway**

Exit interviews and candidate feedback aren‚Äôt just HR checkboxes, they‚Äôre strategic levers. Ignored, they keep companies stuck in a cycle of costly turnover and missed hires. Leveraged, they sharpen hiring practices, strengthen employer brand, and fuel sustainable growth.

For many organizations, the fastest way to turn this overlooked loop into impact is by partnering with an HR outsourcing team equipped to collect, analyze, and act on what employees and candidates are already telling you.
