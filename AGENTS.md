This codebase represents a GitHub Pages / Jekyll hosted web site.

The code actively uses the blog features of Jekyll.

The site uses a commercially purchased theme from ThemeForest.net called Trax. A live preview is here: https://preview.themeforest.net/item/trax-one-page-parallax/full_screen_preview/24907820

The theme was hand-converted from HTML5 to Jekyll / Liquid format on an as-needed basis.

Local environments can test the build with:
bundle exec jekyll build

Remember when building environments that GitHub Pages may not always use the latest gems or ruby. Use the github-pages gem to pull the correct dependencies.
